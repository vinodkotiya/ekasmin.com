01.280 hello everyone we all know that this conference is about the future of enterprise architects and enterprise
08.119 architecture and ai is the future so here to tell us how you can stay ahead
14.480 of ai a practical guide for enterprise architects we please welcome andreas
19.520 welsh of intelligence briefing
26.160 welcome awesome thank you so much for having me it's good to be back in new town square like tim said we'll talk
31.439 about how you can stay ahead of ai in times of so much information news and
37.440 even disruption one thing that i think is super critical is this one right in ai
44.160 and game shows timing is critical because if you buzz in and you want to
51.280 be the first you usually don't have a good answer but if you wait too long
56.559 your competitors have given theirs already and you're too late so timing is
004.840 critical so my name is andreas welsh i am an independent ai strategy adviser um
012.080 i previously spent 23 years at sap in various different leadership roles in and around the topic of ai machine
018.880 learning generative ai um most recently built the marketing organization for
024.320 business ai in um a consistent messaging that you're seeing from from sap today
029.920 it's pretty exciting seeing where sap is taking that now i'm also an adjunct professor at westchester university just
035.680 down the road from here a top voice on linkedin so i would i encourage you to follow me there i post every day about
042.079 how you can implement ai in your business with success and so you can learn about that
048.640 there too so i leave that up here for a second in case you already want to connect
055.320 now look if we if we look at the headlines right
02:01.439 just this year alone just last two months it's pretty crazy right every
02:08.239 week almost every day there's a new headline that goes through the media at the beginning of the year january 6
02:15.280 alman says we're now confident we know how to build artificial general intelligence but next week it was elon
02:21.520 musk saying by the way we've exhausted all human created data the week after we had deepseek for
02:28.720 those of you that follow the ai news right the chinese model and assistant that has uh thrown the market in a
02:34.640 little bit of a turmoil at least for a couple days there and so you see one news piece after the other follows and
02:42.319 it gets really dizzying what is it that i really need to know about what really
02:47.640 matters i'm curious what do you think does any of this matter to the work that you do who's coming out with the latest
02:54.319 foundation model who's who's chasing whom right probably not but we're
03:00.080 inundated with so much news because all of these companies need to show that they're actually doing something right
03:05.680 that they're innovating that they're using the money that they're using the funds that they're receiving to come out with something that maybe outpaces the
03:12.440 next but it's not necessarily helpful for us if we're in enterprise architect or um it roles because there's so much
03:20.239 noise right what what really matters i think today i i saw something in the wall street journal that there's a bit
03:26.400 of a realization that these large data centers that uh are now being built they're not job magnets in the long run
03:33.680 just to build them but then to operate them you actually need fewer people right good and helpful information but how can you actually
03:41.360 make all of that relevant couple of weeks ago early january um
03:49.120 like you saw artificial gel artificial general intelligence was in the news again it's not the first time right so i
03:56.319 could see myself 30 years from now telling my kids how we said time and
04:02.640 again that artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence is near but we've said this 10 years ago 20
04:09.280 years ago since the history of ai started 1955
04:16.440 1956 so there's always been this this drive of what is new what is
04:21.720 coming but things like that right they they've always been a promise so
04:27.479 far but to make it more practical right and put all of these announcements in in
04:32.680 context i mean look at something like this here right ai labs software vendors they're coming
04:39.040 out with new innovations new features on a regular basis right some quarterly some monthly some you have the feeling
04:46.320 they're doing this uh weekly or maybe even daily but then when you look at your own company in your own
04:53.639 landscapes how often are you updating things how quickly are you able to adopt all this new innovation be it from sap
05:00.240 or from any other vendor that you have in your stack right right it's not at the same
05:05.560 pace so what's happening is that this gap is actually widening between what is
05:11.280 possible and what the technology can do and what we are able to adopt in our businesses i think that's a critical
05:17.919 part to keep in mind and and to keep front and center as enterprise architects and as we're learning about
05:24.320 what are the things what are the new things that are coming out how can i help my organization future
05:32.360 proof in the fall gartner ran a survey among ceos and senior it leaders and
05:38.960 they found that actually 74% of ceos recognize that ai will transform the
05:44.320 industry it's great it compared to a couple years ago there's this realization that here's a pivotal moment
05:51.919 we need to do something we can do something we can do things we haven't been able to do before and if we can do
05:57.520 it probably everybody else of our peers and competitors is thinking the same
06:03.720 thing but then the other stat that you frequently see right be it 70% 80 or 85
06:10.000 in this case from gartner 85 85% of ai projects do not deliver value or the
06:17.440 same value that the project sponsors had intended when they started the project right so ai is super important we need
06:23.600 to do something it'll change our industry but then we look at what comes out at the end only 15% of projects
06:31.840 deliver the you so big gap has been there with
06:37.680 machine learning has been there with generative ai i'm sure it'll be there now with the next thing agentic
06:44.280 ai so as much as your vendors want to tell you i would tell you you don't need
06:51.199 more ai no business needs more ai it's kind of counter counterintuitive um to
06:57.360 what you might maybe have heard today as well in yesterday but i firmly believe
07:02.400 no businesses no business needs more ai instead what we need is actually better
07:08.560 prepared ai leadership we need to better understand what are the foundations of our
07:16.360 leadership how we bring ai into our organization how do we operate it not
07:22.880 just in pilot projects but how do we actually scale this to our entire organization globally many different
07:29.880 markets and how do we do that in a way that it's responsible right
07:36.240 my favorite spider-man quote that probably many of you know as well with great power comes great
07:41.960 responsibility if now we have algorithms that can analyze data that can make predictions that can also make
07:47.520 predictions in decisions that affect us as people whether it's employees or our
07:52.560 customers we need to use that technology in a way that is responsible
07:59.199 so in my ai leadership handbook i lay out the nine dimensions of successful ai
08:05.120 leadership in business how can you turn technology hype into business outcomes starts with understanding what
08:12.319 are the market dynamics what is happening yes the headlines are important but not on a daily or on a
08:17.919 weekly basis it's a lot more important to understand what what is happening in the grand scheme of things and how is
08:23.680 that relevant in my business strategy i talked to um some of the attendees
08:30.720 yesterday and said "well you know we need to figure out our ai strategy." yes you probably do but starting with ai is
08:38.080 usually not the best the best place to start right start with the business strategy what are the big objectives
08:43.760 that we're trying to achieve how are we going to to get more revenue how are we opening new markets how are we going to
08:50.720 invest in new product lines and how can technology like ai help us get there
08:58.000 leadership certainly has a big role right in in large organizations you see chief transformation officers chief
09:03.120 digital officers chief data officers maybe in your company you might even have a chief ai officer so a central
09:08.959 role looking at this topic not just from a technology point of view but basically keeping all of these nine aspects in
09:17.160 balance product mindset right we talk a lot about ai projects maybe you've been there too but we need to change that
09:24.160 mindset we need to adopt the product mindset that puts the user in the center not your project
09:30.040 plan and not the end date but the end user culture and collaboration if you're
09:35.760 in in it roles and i have been there myself when i was in it the business was
09:41.120 far far away sure i had an idea what sap does what the different business functions do but there was a lot of
09:49.200 close collaboration for ai to be successful and to deliver meaningful business outcomes and impact you need to
09:55.519 work very very closely with your business you need to work on eye level with your peers to understand what are
10:01.279 the targets that they have what motivates them how can you help them achieve their goals better faster with
10:07.760 the help of technology ethics privacy we already talked about that then obviously technology and
10:14.880 security yes it's still a technology topic but it's actually more of a people topic as well right how do you bring
10:20.560 your people along but you need to understand what are the technologies that are available and how can i use them so you don't need more ai no
10:29.120 business needs more ai i'm of the opinion we need better prepared leadership that takes all of
10:34.480 these things into account right because if you come from a technology background
10:39.680 you're probably super excited by all these opportunities that we can now do all all the things that we have at our
10:45.440 fingertips right chat gpt and many other apps that are on our phones and look at
10:50.800 what we can do with this technology and it's true and it's great but technology doesn't solve a business problem not by
10:56.800 itself right not in a vacuum so that's why we need to keep all of these nine dimensions in
103.240 balance now if you're in an ai leadership role or aspiring to be one probably feel something like
110.440 this again coming back to the the headlines it's very dynamic it's very
117.200 bumpy and you have a really hard time hanging
122.360 on we've seen this with machine learning we've seen this with generative ai usually the same pattern right lots of
128.800 noise lots of talk in in the market about we need to do this you should do this um there are all these new opportunities to do things better and
135.279 faster and cheaper than ever before but nobody really knows what that means and what it looks like because nobody's done
141.040 it before in that same sense so we need to hold on
148.160 but why is that even so bumpy and so dynamic if you look at your business
155.040 whatever business whatever industry you're in there are a number of external factors that influence your business and
12:00.959 your business strategy you have new competitors for example because technologies like ai are now um more
12:08.240 becoming commoditized and anybody in the industry can access them even companies
12:13.600 that don't exist yet will be able to use this as soon as they're formed right and they can out innovate and out compete
12:20.519 you new technologies like we said generative ai agentic ai all the
12:26.320 buzzwords that you have probably heard about already the last couple days and even before that and new products right
12:32.320 you have new entrance using new technologies to create new products that all of a sudden you need to compete with
12:38.480 maybe there are datadriven products maybe there also you know um cloudnative
12:44.240 um vendors technology vendors software vendors that play on on
12:50.240 your turf now everybody or every company is becoming a software company comes to mind there so all of those factors
12:55.839 influence your business strategy which means whatever you set out as your business business strategy 12 months ago
13:02.000 now needs to adapt and that's why you see a lot of this pressure top down also we need to figure out ai we need to know
13:08.560 and find a way how to use this technology in a way that it helps us move our business forward that's where a
13:14.959 lot of the pressure comes from because the market doesn't stand stand
13:22.120 still but i would also caution you that not every business problem is an ai
13:28.600 problem so i'll let this sit for a second not every business problem is an
13:34.320 ai problem and in all of this excitement and maybe haste to do
13:39.839 something with ai we need to figure this out we need to see where and how we can use ai and let's give everybody co-pilot
13:45.440 and they will be more productive in a couple days doesn't quite happen that way right so we need to think about the
13:54.839 problem last and the solution first instead of the technology
14:03.040 many great technologies that we can use to solve individual problems maybe ai is the answer maybe rules maybe traditional
14:09.600 programming is the answer but just because ai is available we shouldn't jump immediately at that opportunity and
14:16.079 say well let's figure out how we can use ai that's skinning the cat the wrong way
14:22.160 but we've seen this progression from machine learning where we were able to classify and predict data and
14:28.000 information is this a cat a dog is this a drill this is a hammer type things to
14:34.399 yeah identification generation right early um early image generation with
14:39.440 deep learning processing things at a massive parallel pace in um scale to
14:46.399 generative ai we're able to create we're able to interpret what's what do you see in this
14:52.480 image can you analyze the tone of of this text can you write it in similar style to now where we see the white
15:00.959 circle agentic ai where we are delegating more of our own agency to these ai systems and they can reason and
15:07.760 they can even execute tasks on our behalf we're seeing not only the the first glimpses but even the first
15:14.160 examples in industry where companies are are looking at this
15:19.639 so you need to think about the solution first and then about the technology sounds very basic and very
15:26.519 fundamental but again in this excitement about ai something we need to keep in
15:31.800 mind but we're moving towards more and more automation and more and more autonomous automation and if you think
15:38.800 about the bottom left here we started with rules right in your erp system whether you use s for hana or ecc there
15:46.079 are many many rules i remember working on finance projects many years ago to match incoming payments to open invoices
15:53.440 guess what that was based on rules that maybe you and your business have
15:59.560 defined then it was all about rpa robotic process automation hey we can automate the integration between two
16:06.480 disparate systems go log in here download an invoice extract the information upload
16:12.399 it in erp boom off we go talked about machine learning we look at
16:17.920 at data we look at patterns in data to make decisions and to give
16:23.000 recommendations and now all of a sudden we're actually moving to the part where we are able to implement these
16:28.079 recommendations where agents will be able to implement these
16:33.399 recommendations and thinking about how this changed the paradigm how this changes the paradigm of how we work and how our users work i think that's pretty
16:40.880 significant right i've always done this in a certain way for the last 10 or 12 years i know how to run this process now
16:48.240 not only do i have an ai that tells me how to do it better it does it faster and i have not even an idea of how it
16:54.560 comes up with that suggestion so what you likely face is a
16:59.680 lot of resistance as well in in the workforce when you engage in ai projects
17:05.119 i've been doing this myself i don't need an ai to tell me how to do this i know it better and it gets really difficult
17:12.079 right because if you have people who are so skeptical that they are not going to adopt it or maybe they even override
17:17.599 what the system proposes and doesn't deliver the value that you intend and we're back to the
17:23.439 85% of ai projects that do not deliver the value as
17:29.080 intended so like i said earlier right about a month ago um chinese company
17:35.039 deeps put a new ai assistant on the market market went crazy financial market went
17:41.840 crazy well what about all these data centers what about all these chips what about all the hardware nvidia's stock
17:47.760 tanked by i think 17% in a single trading session um the the highest loss
17:53.280 in in market cap in the history but what does that actually mean
17:58.960 if you think about it something that you see here to your left was also coming up
18:06.559 this economic principle that's called jevans paradox goes back to the 18th century um by british economist jevans
18:14.640 who found that as the cost of a good drops the demand actually increases it
18:20.640 was observed in energy with coal with
18:25.880 fuel and the anticipation is that we'll see the same thing happen with ai as well if ai gets cheaper and cheaper that
18:32.320 was the big thing for deepseek we don't need as many high performance compute appliances we don't need the
18:38.480 latest chips but we can get very good results and we can even match or outpace and outperform what openai and others
18:45.440 are putting out there if the cost drops the demand surges now put that in
18:53.160 context bcg at the end of last year found that companies who are leaders in
18:58.200 ai follow this 10 2070 rule they invest about 10% in algorithms 20
19:05.919 in basic technology and 70 in what you see below the surface
19:11.440 here below the waterline of the iceberg people in processes right yes we talk
19:16.640 about technology but if you talk about to your peers here where are the challenges in
19:22.320 your organization why are things not working as fast as they should why are we not seeing the adoption why don't we even know where to
19:27.799 start very few times it's technology very few times it's algorithms right
19:33.760 it's because we have been used to working in a certain way our peers have been used to working in a certain way so
19:42.000 even though companies follow this 10 207 70 rule still two out of three companies
19:48.320 fail making their ai strategy successful because they are just struggling to reimagine how can we create these new
19:55.360 workflows with ai how does it change our work and how do we bring our people along on this journey and how do we
20:01.280 upscale them how do we give them not only the tools but also the training to use these tools
20:08.440 properly so take that in context again with german's
20:13.960 paradox the cost for ai is going to drop it's going to be commoditized even
20:20.400 more there's going to be more demand which means that the pressure is
20:26.640 going to rise as well if it's cheaper for you and for you and for you and for you and you're in competition with each
20:32.120 other oh boy your ceo is probably going to put even more pressure on the ai team
20:38.080 or on the enterprise architecture team and say "we need to figure this out we need to do more ai and bring in more ai
20:43.760 to our company." but if already two out of three are struggling with this right
20:51.120 you're at the risk of just creating more sunk cost if you don't do it right it's just faster right we can use more
20:59.159 ai in ways that are less less expensive so let's try out even more we need to find ways to use ai and again that's
205.960 usually the starting point on a road to to failure so why do projects fail
215.760 from my experience having worked with many fortune 500s while i was working for sap and now outside as well there's
221.840 one common theme for example ai projects are unlike any other it projects that
227.200 any of us have been engaged in right usually a project has a start and an end
232.960 date it's pretty linear you look at your project plan you take the the different uh work packages you assign um work
240.640 package owners you have resources you have deadlines ai projects they're usually
246.960 different right especially if you build ai models from scratch if you don't if you don't use anything that you can
252.880 quickly configure or flip on uh in your application so if you build ai from scratch it's a lot more iterative it's a
259.360 lot more like a research project and not many leaders understand
22:05.760 right maybe your senior leadership your top management isn't aware that this is not a start to finish
22:12.280 project but it goes in circles goes in iterations and maybe sometimes after
22:18.400 iteration two you look at the room you look at the data and you say well we can either
22:24.799 extend this by another month or a quarter and hope that we get a good result right maybe the the next
22:30.559 breakthrough is just around the corner or maybe sometimes you also need to be honest with yourself and say "well this
22:35.840 is not going as well as we thought it would be we're not seeing the results that we need so let's stop after
22:41.039 iteration 2 let's park this or maybe let's revisit this again." we'll also come back to data again right it all
22:48.480 comes back to data even though we're talking about ai everybody wants to talk about shiny new objects what are we
22:54.400 doing with ai how are we increasing productivity how are we selling more how are we doing how are we reducing cost at
23:00.400 the end of the day comes back to data right and most organizations are not very well prepared they are very well
23:06.360 organized because data projects are not as shiny as ai
23:11.640 projects so when should you stop an ai project i think that's as important as
23:16.960 figuring out when should you start it i'm actually recording a course with linkedin learning on this later this
23:23.280 week because you know as much as we want to talk about where can we use ai and
23:29.760 how can we use it it's important to get alignment from the very beginning with your senior leadership as well and what
23:35.600 are the success criteria what are we actually trying to achieve here how long do we think it's going to
23:41.360 take right if you think about the iterative process it's very hard to estimate in some cases right you're
23:46.559 optimistic that it takes 3 months 6 months later you're still in cycle number two or number
23:53.320 three so when do you pull the plug measuring the roi of the resources you
23:58.880 have if you have data scientists or developers keeping them on this project or assigning them to something else right when do we need to make a decision
24:05.440 like that and additional points here but if you don't do that if you
24:12.080 don't set these criteria you're basically just encouraging to kick the can down the
24:18.400 road and hope for the next breakthrough that maybe will happen and hopefully will happen next week next month if we
24:23.919 only get a little more data if we only talk to one more stakeholder if we only do this then it'll be
24:31.240 successful because at the end of the day there's also reputation involved in this right if your if you or your manager has
24:37.840 promised up the chain that this is a project that's worth investing in it's
24:43.679 very hard to go back and say actually didn't quite work right didn't didn't work out as well as we thought it would
24:49.440 be because it's your reputation their reputation at the end of the day that's on the line so if you create this
24:56.640 understanding if you create this understanding of what are the aspects that we need to check on every project check in at least on a monthly basis how
25:04.240 are we doing against these criteria then you have a way out then you can say well this is not where we should spend our
25:09.919 time this is not where we should spend our money and you can raise that awareness that projects are not linear
25:15.360 but they're more cyclical in that nature and more iterative
25:21.279 so how do you overcome adoption blockers right you you built something give it to the the organization you've worked with
25:27.440 your business stakeholders um but maybe you're not as
25:32.960 excited as as you think they were in in the very beginning by the way the numbering is
25:39.840 not by intent all number one but they're they're all important right that's the other thing everything is a priority no
25:46.720 but joking aside right you need to define the business problem very clearly and from the very beginning what is it
25:52.159 that we're actually trying to solve again comes back to is ai even the right technology to solve it how do we measure
25:58.480 it what is a measurable kpi or a process performance indicator that we can take where we can measure the impact of the
26:05.679 ai that we build or that we implement what's that kpi that your business stakeholder is being measured
26:11.960 by what does success look like for them and how can you help them achieve that success
26:18.080 are there existing applications right think of sap sap has invested a lot in
26:23.200 ai has made many ai genai capabilities available is there anything in these
26:28.559 applications that we already use today that we can configure that we can
26:33.600 activate or as we're moving to a future version what are the things that we should be thinking about applies to any
26:39.279 other vendor that you have in your stack as well review data do we have the right data fresh data current data complete
26:46.840 data doesn't go away right and involve end users because they are the ones that
26:53.200 will ultimately decide are we going to use this am i going to use this am i going to use this in the right way or do
26:58.400 you think this thing is going to cost me my job and i'm just training my
27:04.440 replacement so involving end users is critical but we still have to talk about
27:09.600 it still have to mention it because more times than not it's not really happening especially in these ai projects
27:16.880 so what will be the challenges to overcome on one hand any vendor in the
27:24.320 industry with the ai that they put out there with the agents they put out there they need to live up to the expectations and sometimes marketing is a little
27:30.559 ahead of technology it can happen but for any company to trust that the ai
27:38.880 does what it's supposed to and what you what your vendor says it is going to do we need to establish that the level of
27:45.279 of trust and that robustness but as you go up and your
27:50.720 employees your team members they will wonder what does it mean for me right if all of a sudden there's more ai again am i training my replacement do
27:58.480 i still have a job three months from now six months from now you see all the layoffs across different industries that are
28:05.080 happening right trust is is shaken up to to a good extent so as a leader you need
28:10.320 to figure out what what is our strategy to begin with how does ai align with our business strategy how does it help us
28:16.640 achieve these goals how do we drive that change how do we communicate clearly and openly and transparently with our
28:23.559 employees which sounds a lot easier it sounds a lot more logical than it is and
28:29.360 sometimes you cannot obviously say everything but showing empathy i think is is
28:34.960 critically important and we're all in this together right we're all figuring out what does that mean that future with
28:40.279 ai how are we going to to work with this new technology so encouraging team members as well and empowering them to
28:46.240 to try this out then again also comes down to data right if you build if you
28:52.240 build an ai system that should gather information about your your products maybe a maintenance information you want
28:58.640 to make the information available to your customers you still need data you need your business data not what openai
29:05.200 has built into their large language model for
29:11.240 example so a couple weeks ago i met with an engineering firm about a billion dollar in in
29:18.520 revenue sitting at the table across from the ceo the cfo
29:23.919 the chief strategy officer we're talking about ai we quickly figured out by the way it's not an ai transformation it's a
29:30.000 business transformation that was actually needed and ai should be an enabler but the ceo said well our it
29:37.880 department they say we only keep the network secure that's what we focus on we don't do
29:43.000 innovation said well what do you think how many people in your organization use chat gpt
29:49.360 use deepsseek use unapproved apps like well yeah you're actually right right so by just focusing on how do we secure our
29:57.080 perimeter we're actually excluding and ignoring anything else that big wave
30:02.880 that is going to hit us because your employees are going to use ai they are using ai already today so it's a matter
30:10.240 of how do you embrace this how do you empower them and give them guidelines and recommendations how you should use
30:16.399 these apps right don't put confidential data in there don't put uh any ip there don't put um personal identifiable
30:23.520 information there some basic ground rules but just ignoring saying well we
30:30.159 only worry about anything that happens all the way to our firewall and anything anything after that any new apps we
30:36.559 don't care about won't work right because your users are going to go where they get the most productivity and if
30:43.760 that is new apps if it's apps maybe even on their personal phones you end up with a situation like
30:54.360 this in the fall there was an interesting study that slack um the the workforce and uh messaging platform did
302.399 and they found that 46% of the respondents said "i'm actually not telling my manager that i use ai because
309.679 if i do they either think i'm lazy or i'm incompetent or i just get more
315.919 work." so i'm more productive but i'm not telling anybody that also tells you a lot about
322.880 culture and corporate culture right and again that trust piece
328.520 so you see it's it's not about technology right it's not about ai it's about how do we empower and encourage
334.399 our employees to use these technologies to try them out to try them out in ways that are safe that are approved maybe
341.600 even encourage them to try it out outside of work on on their own devices but we need to increase that literacy as
348.000 well to stay ahead and the same applies to all of us in in the room as well right there's so many tools that are
353.519 coming out on a weekly basis on a monthly basis but unless we start to use
359.399 them right just reading about them won't make us uh more more competent or or
32:05.200 more proficient in using them in understanding where the limitations are and understanding where the opportunities are
32:11.640 so your team members your teammates maybe even yourself they're afraid telling their
32:17.760 manager i use ai i'm more productive because it means probably end up with more
32:24.760 work but how can you get there how can you scale ai from this initial idea
32:29.840 maybe this initial project that you have all the way across your organization maybe you've done this in
32:36.159 in other projects before i've seen this work quite well actually at sap u when i was in in the s4ana engineering
32:42.559 organization how can we get more people engaged in the topic of ai how can we
32:48.159 get them more excited and give them more training also and the same applies right in in your company too so you can set up
32:55.120 a community of multipliers identify people in the organization who are really really good really skilled at
33:02.159 adopting new technologies who are curious who who maybe go to the the robo cup or the the lego i don't know
33:09.120 transformation or transformers cup or something like this who tinker with iot people who have an affinity for for
33:15.320 technology get them together give them training about what is what is ai
33:21.120 they're very early on in in their journey what's available to us how can we use this and also have them network
33:27.120 with each other there's by the way an interesting um finding for for us at at sap that our engineering teams and
33:34.159 product managers said well we don't just want to sit there and go through a curriculum we actually want to talk to others in here what's working for you
33:40.720 what have you tried where did you hit a roadblock so not to be underestimated so multipliers right bring organizations
33:46.880 along they can these multipliers um can help you scale they can also um become a
33:53.760 feedback channel for you the things that you roll out how well are they being received how well how well are they being used where are new opportunities
33:59.600 that we can look at and bring more ai and more efficiency into that
34:10.280 organization and then the question is how do you how do you put this into a portfolio how do you put this in into an
34:16.159 idea funnel for example some things will be very early on maybe it's an ideation or i talked to
34:23.520 somebody in in finance and they said "here's an opportunity that could help us close the books faster send invoices
34:28.879 faster if only we were able to automate it more for example you have things that
34:34.560 are invalidation maybe with your engineering teams or your data scientists you have things that are being built so the idea is to to build
34:41.918 this pipeline along these five stages and also assess what's the business
34:47.119 value of an idea is this is this even worth pursuing or are we just doing that so we have fewer clicks and happier
34:53.119 employees right both highly commendable goals but maybe your cfo is not so
34:58.160 excited about just having happier employees and just fewer clicks how can we reduce the sales
35:04.880 outstanding how we can how can we reduce other metrics that move the business forward and where we can actually measure the impact so building that
35:12.240 pipeline of ideas is also critical to to show what are the the opportunists that we see
35:18.400 right it's perfectly fine to say well we we looked at all these and half of those actually don't turn out to be so
35:23.839 valuable as we thought initially so maybe they don't even move beyond ideation or maybe you see at the end of
35:29.040 validation that are not uh providing the value that you expect and again that brings us back to when should you stop
35:35.760 your ai project so as controversial as mr musk
35:43.760 might be these days couple weeks ago he said "hey we've exhausted the cumulative
35:49.359 sum of human knowledge in data in ai training." and they caught some waves
35:55.280 and people said well did did we really have we really reached the end of the internet and scooped up all the data
36:01.599 that is now in large language models and available at our fingertips and i would say we we to some extent we have but we
36:09.359 haven't exhausted all the data right because the value as we know the real value is in the data that is in your
36:15.359 business right that is specific to your process specific to your products to the services you offer it's a matter of how
36:21.760 make how do we make that usable and accessible to the ai so we get better results so we get better recommendations
36:28.160 so yes it does come back to data again but i think that's also where the
36:34.079 opportunity is so garbage in garbage out still
36:41.079 applies unpopular to do data projects if you can do ai projects and that's where you get the
36:47.119 funding the data projects yeah who wants to talk about data but you have to right you have to lay the foundation if you
36:53.680 want to build that skyscraper otherwise it's going to be on shaky ground you're not going to realize um those benefits
36:59.920 that you expect but data also mirrors what we see
37:06.160 in in the real world right mirrors the same biases the same world views to some extent that we have that are encoded in
37:12.800 data so we need to be aware of that too as we build ai systems that there are
37:17.880 some preferences some biases in in there you can test this out yourself right go
37:22.960 to chat gpt and um ask it a question the
37:28.160 doctor was late um the the doctor yelled at the nurse because he was late who was
37:34.320 late in most cases chat gpt will tell you he
37:39.520 equals the doctor just because statistically there probably more male doctors than female doctors so in a
37:45.200 similar way as you work with data you need to be aware of these these biases as
37:53.800 well so how can you support the adoption of ai and agents in your company i think
38:00.880 first of all by realizing that this gap exists there's so much new technology that's coming out on a weekly on a
38:06.800 monthly on a quarterly basis that's hard to even absorb and understand what's
38:12.160 happening so staying on top of larger trends that are happening in the industry things that vendors like sap
38:18.240 and others are doing anticipating where are they going what does it mean for my business how can i prepare for this kind
38:24.560 of technology to adopt it and to bring it into my organization and ultimately see that you close the gap right as much
38:31.280 as you can
38:38.599 so to bring it home right the three three key
38:43.800 things that stay pretty much universal doesn't matter if you talk about machine learning about ai and if we'll talk about quantum computing in two years or
38:50.960 in five years stay aware of the trends what is happening largely in in the industry how
38:56.960 does it impact my business my industry our organization how can we use these
39:02.200 technologies to our advantage to either make more money or
39:07.920 save more money it always comes down to to these two things how can we bring our people along
39:13.280 on this journey and encourage them to use this technology and try it out because actually we want you to use this
39:18.480 right we we expect you to be productive and more productive you're not lazy just because you use chat gpt
39:24.880 but if you do use it please also tell others how you use it let's share the knowledge so everybody benefits from it
39:31.680 and then yes it always comes back to data so if you like to focus or if you
39:38.880 like to learn more um about other resources that are available i have two
39:44.000 courses out on linkedin learning about agentic ai i just started my private community the ai leadership circle and
39:51.119 if you stick around for a little bit outside we even have a book signing of the ai leadership handbook so make sure
39:56.400 to grab your copy this afternoon thank you so much
40:05.040 thank

00.030 the metamodel is a really important
02.730 concept in enterprise architecture so in
05.339 this module we're going to look at what
07.350 is a meta model and how is it used in
09.630 enterprise architecture we've already
12.000 No text
13.080 seen that an enterprise is a system and
15.660 that a system is made up of components
17.670 or building blocks those components
21.660 their properties and the relationships
23.789 between them are the things that are
26.130 described in an enterprise architecture
28.070 metamodel those components in the
31.019 metamodel are often referred to as
33.510 constructs so we've got this notion that
36.600 a system or enterprise is made up of the
39.210 components or building blocks and the
42.360 types of components and building blocks
44.670 are the things that are described in the
46.890 metamodel it's not all the specific
49.770 instances of an application for example
52.469 but is the notion that there is a thing
55.559 called an application and it's one of
58.379 the building blocks that make up an
000.750 enterprise architecture so why is a meta
003.000 No text
004.680 model so useful well firstly it provides
010.470 a formal definition of those constructs
013.020 the properties and the relationships
014.880 between them and having a formal
017.340 definition means that we have some
020.180 consistency and we can structure our
024.500 architectural thinking and it also
027.810 ensures that we consider all of the
030.390 relevant components if we've got a
032.009 detailed meta model of the types of
034.500 component in the enterprise architecture
037.020 then we can be assured that we are
039.659 considering all of those components
041.490 whenever we conduct an architecture
044.610 engagement and the meta model also shows
048.630 how those components are used to build
052.049 an enterprise architecture
053.939 it shows the allowable ways of
056.729 configuring and grouping those
059.390 components they are those constructs so
02:02.100 that we can create an architecture once
02:04.000 No text
02:05.610 we've got an enterprise architecture
02:07.129 metamodel how do we actually use it well
02:10.590 firstly we use it to define and document
02:13.470 the
02:13.890 strikes that we're going to need and
02:15.780 that we're going to use within the
02:17.370 enterprise architecture so any type of
02:19.819 construct any type of relationship that
02:23.069 we need in the architecture should be
02:25.770 documented in the enterprise
02:27.480 architecture metamodel the second thing
02:30.810 is that once we've got this meta model
02:32.760 we can use it to analyze both current
02:34.800 and target architecture configurations
02:37.440 we can see how the architecture is
02:39.810 currently structured why there might be
02:43.260 limitations for example we might have a
02:46.290 link between application and process but
02:50.400 we need an additional link between
02:52.070 application and workflow in order to
02:54.989 really manage the needs of business
02:58.110 stakeholders and that would show up in
03:00.959 the metamodel because it would probably
03:02.790 be a relationship that we didn't already
03:05.250 have so as part of the change to the
03:08.160 architecture we would also require
03:10.350 change in the meta model we also use the
03:14.250 meta model to consider alternatives and
03:16.769 options if we're looking at different
03:19.140 ways in which we might change the
03:21.239 architecture in the future the meta
03:24.420 model is a very good tool to see
03:26.579 different groupings different ways in
03:28.950 which we might combine the components to
03:32.100 create the needs that the business
03:33.900 people have and we also use the meta
03:38.220 model to cover all stakeholder
03:40.110 viewpoints and views now this is
03:43.700 something that's very important we
03:46.590 already know that we have multiple
03:48.690 stakeholders and they all have different
03:50.310 views and viewpoints but the meta model
03:54.570 is an essential tool for making sure
03:56.940 that we can represent their needs from
04:01.680 their particular viewpoint the metamodel
04:04.350 needs to be multi-dimensional it needs
04:06.780 to be able to look at the architecture
04:09.120 from many different perspectives so the
04:13.000 No text
04:14.489 key learning points here the building
04:16.829 blocks of an enterprise architecture are
04:18.690 described as components or constructs in
04:22.260 an enterprise architecture meta model
04:24.419 there
04:25.560 two different ways in which you can
04:27.330 spell metamodel sometimes it's written
04:29.610 as modern word sometimes as two words
04:32.750 it's useful to divide the metamodel into
04:35.610 distinct areas typically and most
04:38.490 usefully those coincide with the
04:40.860 different domains so it's useful to
04:42.810 group the business architecture
04:44.630 components together the application
04:47.030 architecture components together and
04:49.260 this would also be true in the
04:50.910 subdomains as well the metamodel
04:54.630 shouldn't be overlooked it really is a
04:57.990 highly useful highly practical and
05:00.540 totally indispensible enterprise
05:03.360 architecture tool so often I find
05:07.220 Enterprise Architecture teams don't
05:09.390 realize the importance and the value of
05:12.030 the metamodel so they don't take it into
05:14.580 account they don't use it as effectively
05:16.680 as they could

05.359 so this presentation is developing an effective ea repository with great amounts of data comes great
12.320 responsibility and how to transform your repository into that single source of truth to make informed decisions
20.880 so the agenda on this presentation is um showing you how um how we created a
21.000 No text
26.400 roadmap in the boarding of the ea repository how to build an effective meta model um
31.760 for business application data and technology architectural streams uh what are the
39.520 sources of truth of the data what does the integration process look like
44.879 how to produce the content to provide those beneficial insights and make them engaging and how does that
50.719 take up look like how to mature the ea capability through the use of the repository
55.840 and finally i will take any questions and i hope to answer them
000.960 so a little bit about me um charlie mentioned uh i'm a senior enterprise architect in einstein i've worked with then star
007.439 for nearly two years now um have a background about over four and a half years in enterprise architecture
014.640 but i have an overall uh 20 years experience in iit and consultancy um developing
021.200 systems and products and architecting solutions i worked in many different
028.799 sectors predominantly insurance also finance manufacturing energy motoring retail and
035.360 entertainment just a disclaimer all opinions expressed or implied in this presentation of those
041.520 of myself they don't necessarily reflect the views of enstar or evolution
046.799 and my linkedin address is below so a little bit about nstar so it was
050.000 No text
053.280 founded in 1993 um it has a global footprint
058.640 of over 30 offices headquarters in bermuda but many offices in the u.s eu
02:05.200 and australia it has over a thousand employees and has made a hundred acquisitions since its
02:12.080 formation so endstar is a insurance run-off consolidator
02:17.840 for non-life runoff insurance and this would be employees liability workers comp marine
02:23.840 transport aviation and construction and he became the largest runoff consolidator in 2013
02:30.160 and offers expertise in risk analysis and investment so manages insurance and reinsurance
02:36.879 companies and portfolios um and here's sort of a diagram an
02:42.319 example to show um what that process looks like when we when install makes an acquisition
02:49.760 looks at the sellers who wish to sell their um books of business for for a premium so
02:55.760 it enters an agreement with the seller to cover the future claims for that premium
03:01.360 and that could be through a number of sell options either share purchase portfolio transfer or
03:07.200 reinsurance arrangements so this other benefits from this from the release
03:13.440 of its capital and the administration efforts enstar then
03:19.680 invests in that premium it gains from the sale and then manages and handles those claims
03:26.799 the profit it returns to the shareholders is the return of investment plus any
03:32.239 claim savings nsar also offers opportunities for computation which is offsetting the
03:38.480 credits and debts as we've acquired multiple books of business or portfolios over the years
03:44.720 that that's that's the that means that it's increases or maximizes the profit to the
03:50.319 shareholders so because of the um ever-changing
03:54.000 No text
03:57.519 landscape of n-star with its acquisitions and divestments the landscape does change considerably
04:04.159 and provides those um it provides a challenge for for
04:09.840 for ourselves so across the the world in the eu us and the rest of
04:16.160 the world end star is actually comprised of a number of holding companies
04:21.918 within those holding companies there's a number of limited insurance and reinsurance
04:26.960 companies within those insurance companies there's a number of books of business
04:33.520 that are managed by those limited companies and with this complex
04:40.840 business there's a systems landscape beneath it all that has a number of
04:48.160 systems shared services across claims reinsurance finance systems data warehouses data
04:53.919 marts that provide the data ultimately to the reporting platforms so it always becomes a constant
04:59.440 challenge to try to understand the future with the future acquisitions or future divestments what the system
05:06.240 landscape could look like or should look like
05:11.919 and there's more um common uh challenges that i'm sure many of you will be aware of that
05:19.360 there's a number of repositories for documentation that can exist in ms teams sharepoint document libraries or
05:26.400 existing ea repositories which we which we have or they could just sit on someone's local drive or email or even people's
05:31.840 heads and those and the type of diagrams that are often beneficial for change can be spread in
05:38.880 many of these different areas and they're often of good quality at that point of time but over years
05:45.520 they become locked in people's heads or the the discovery process becomes challenging
05:50.800 so when there are new business opportunities or um or through acquisitions or if there's drivers to
05:56.400 improve the business efficiencies such as finance process improvements or claims handling or there's um there's new
06:04.880 regulations in in certain um jurisdiction um then this offers um a challenge
06:12.800 when it comes to change and the discovery and analysis of this documentation um can take weeks
06:20.240 and this is what we see the the ea repository um to help reduce that time considerably
06:28.000 No text
06:28.880 so what was our journey um how do we board from the initial procurement of
06:35.440 up abacus well once we went through the initial
06:40.639 selection procedure we started to configure and set this up
06:46.080 we had initial training with our core architecture team and some initial kickoff sessions
06:52.479 and through this initial setup we then created a first draft of the meta model and this
06:59.039 was just to understand how to configure it uh set up some basic users and groups
07:04.160 and then ways of working um and we started work on the initial content
07:10.160 and after about eight weeks um we started to create some true content so we had a meta model that was able to to be
07:17.599 utilized for some solution diagrams we were creating for existing projects
07:23.440 uh we had a integration set up with us our configuration management the
07:29.039 database service now and we started to create dashboards showing the technical debt matrix
07:37.599 then we started to publish this information to a wider audience within
07:42.639 the enterprise started to create our capability models
07:47.680 um looking from a level one down to level three and even level four um creating more dashboards ready for
07:54.319 publishing and some high-level enterprise architecture views
08:00.560 then as we started to increase the amount of content over sort of four month period we
08:06.240 started to onboard some of the existing work that we had done prior to adopting
08:12.160 the tool such as the application roadmap three year plan we started creating some traditional
08:17.919 architecture diagrams we increased the meta model and the constraints between them and created
08:23.599 more viewpoints and and now from six months onwards we're we're we're
08:29.440 we're embedding the process into core solution architecture work and we've got dashboards that are used
08:35.519 for a wider consumption and we had the demos to the i.t buildings at large and to other
08:40.640 stakeholders outside in in the business and now we're starting to look at what does the governance and
08:46.959 change process and control look like to content authors and looking to begin this adoption
08:52.640 outside of the architecture community
08:57.000 No text
08:59.040 so the first thing we want to do is to look at the meta model and the approach to that was
09:04.959 to look at a model that would fulfill all potential use cases create a base meta model that couldn't
09:10.880 be expanded as the content evolves but utilize the best of breed of existing languages
09:16.959 we didn't want to reinvent the wheel completely and we wanted to limit the number of allowed connections
09:24.640 uh i believe in when we to create content there's no right answer to create the diagrams but a simplified
09:30.720 model can really help to provide that consistency
09:36.000 so we looked at archimate as the as the boilerplate if you like um for creating the meta model but we
09:42.320 took lots of elements from bizbok um for the business architecture um
09:47.360 viewpoints and we also used some components of the bpmn notation as
09:52.880 well so we could provide better business process to diagrams that are understood by the business
10:02.839 analysts so this then creates our own n-star meta model
10:08.240 that is um you know it's got some specific elements to to n-style but it can be
10:14.160 used i think in across of other other industry areas as well
10:19.000 No text
10:20.000 the metamodel design looks like this we have a quite a rich number of component types
10:25.120 now in our repository we have and they're all
10:30.640 composed into various groups so we have motivational component types people strategy
10:37.360 project business application the data and infrastructure
10:43.200 and these component types are used across a number of viewpoints so we have uh we started creating the
10:49.040 solution architecture viewpoint as our first one and then created a business architecture
10:54.160 one and we created a business with the benefit viewpoint as well which would be of use i think with
101.680 portfolio managers in the future and then we created the bpm diagram and we have a graph
107.440 viewpoint as well which is useful for the enterprise dashboards the ones that we're looking to do in the
113.200 future is a sort of a cloud specific technology viewpoint and one that's specific to um projects
118.880 and programs and looking at showing how change affects the system landscapes
127.000 No text
128.720 so this is our solution architecture viewpoint and you can see here that the
134.000 application component type is sort of central to to to this viewpoint and with in here we
140.160 have the concept of an application that is composed of application modules
145.440 um with other logical components that aren't native to archimate such as the logical with the database and the
150.959 logical the document store we wanted to show how relational databases or document
156.480 repositories look within these kind of views these are then linked to physical
12:03.600 counterparts so we have the physical database or database instance then that relates
12:10.240 to a logical database so we're able to show environments uh specific
12:15.920 uh views as well with this one single viewpoint uh we also have the data objects as well
12:22.399 so we have the concept of a data set which can can correspond to either a database schema
12:29.519 in a relational database or record or a report schema in power bi or cognos or some other bi tool
12:36.959 and then the data objects correspond to uh let's say a data table and then you can then identify
12:43.600 individual data writer elements within here as well
12:49.000 No text
12:50.480 for the business architecture viewpoint um this is um capability organization and value
12:58.000 streams essential to this to this viewpoint uh we wanted to show uh capabilities and how they realize
13:06.079 the value stream and the value stream stages are components within value streams
13:11.839 components within the value streams um and a couple of motivational view
13:17.440 component types as well on how those value streams serve either external or internal stakeholders
13:23.040 the organizations are composed of business units that realize business functions of which
13:29.040 the business processes then serve those business functions and they also relate to the value streams
13:35.440 we have um some specific component types here we've got portfolio and class of business where we wanted to
13:41.920 show which organizations own which portfolios and which portfolios then manages or has
13:48.720 specific classes of business and though they're then also linked to applications
13:54.480 and then applications which applications support which classes of business
14:03.440 and then the technology viewpoints at the moment we we we've got one that's um utilizing graph
14:09.680 dots which is a great visualization in of abacus um where we can see from a particular
14:17.120 starting node such as a server what relationships um are associated to those
14:22.639 um to that starting node so a server might be hosted on a particular
14:28.240 location um hosted in within the data center or in the cloud
14:33.920 um we'll have number of infrastructure services those application modules then will be linked to an application
14:41.519 those applications can be allocated up to an each ecosystem uh one thing i forgot to mention in the
14:46.880 other slide is that we use the ecosystem as a term to um group up
14:52.160 a more granular level of applications so that it's easier to communicate and convey
14:58.160 certain decisions when these high-level groupings are used
15:06.000 No text
15:07.839 we have a benefit realization viewpoint where um where in order to justify
15:15.760 the project or to initiate a project we we have these mandates or charters and there's
15:21.199 always a benefits case to determine um is it worth doing is it worth doing
15:26.399 this project um and one of the i think the flexible things of
15:31.440 abacus is to be able to create viewpoints like this where we can actually quantify what the benefits are and to
15:37.199 show that in a diagram so that's key to decision stakeholders can actually use this
15:42.240 and they can see and measure um what those 2b capability models should would look
15:49.040 like with the solution changes and how the projects and the deliverables on those projects
15:54.160 then realize those changes in the capabilities and then we can show how these then are
15:59.519 aligned to any strategic objectives
16:04.800 and then link to the ultimate mission and vision of which drives those objectives
16:15.000 No text
16:16.560 our bp men viewpoints the goal here was to use the existing component types in the
16:22.560 meta model as much as we could so that's when we talk about a business process either in an archimate focus
16:28.240 diagram or a bpm diagram here they are the same thing
16:33.839 and that was easy to do what we're able to um show here is that the activities
16:41.040 that you see here are actually just business processes and the events the triggers are business
16:48.880 events and we used um super types and and then derived
16:54.399 types to show which are message events for example or start and end events
17:01.519 and those then can be linked to the value streams here so that's whether you're we've created a
17:07.919 process flow diagram at this level where it's you can see the the swim lanes associated with either business units or
17:16.839 roles those saying this same um contenting it can be used in
17:22.079 a argument style diagram could look different but mean exactly the same thing um we also wanted to extend this
17:27.760 particular view to show value stream as well because that means that we can show where the relationship between
17:33.120 processes business processes to value streams to capabilities and that triangle then helps helps drive
17:40.320 these conversations that we need that these are useful for
17:46.000 No text
17:47.440 so how do we um what is our integration strategy look like into the a repository so as we
17:54.400 were growing the contents um in the a repository we have a num we had a number of
18:00.000 existing sources so one of the goals was to um adopt uh
18:05.919 abacus was to try to consolidate this try to create these single views so that um i t multiple
18:13.520 it teams or other business teams didn't have their own source of data
18:18.880 they could they could use a trusted source of data but there's challenges to that as you
18:24.960 can see here there's uh in abacus like you see in the center
18:30.640 there are a number of existing um data sources and repositories um that have its own source of data and
18:38.320 some of these are um good and accurate and can be used um and some of them would probably
18:45.919 would benefit from being synchronized from another data source so we have existing for example we have
18:51.840 existing like spreadsheets vendor spreadsheets but it was very
18:56.880 manually maintained um not shown on here but we we are adopting a um
19:03.200 a management software event event i'm sorry a vendor related vendor management software package that
19:09.520 we're just introducing now so that will help um you know consolidate and make
19:15.360 um make that more of a trusted source but with all these data sources we have
19:21.280 trying to describe here in this diagram is the notion of a source of record and ultimate source
19:26.320 of record what is a trusted source what's a copy of the data that's local and useful for that particular function
19:32.960 that that software is used for and this was a very useful diagram um when conveying this to various i.t
19:40.160 stakeholders and trying to describe the nature of the problem and how do we consolidate and improve the quality of
19:47.200 the data across these different systems as we
19:52.240 are now um adopting a cloud platform for all of our services uh and applications
19:59.520 it now becomes a source of record for um database database instances servers
20:06.720 applications to some extent and that and that information then needs to be re-synchronized
20:12.000 to abacus we've determined the best way to do that in order to keep any cloud hosted
20:19.520 systems and non-cloud asset systems is to centralize that in our existing cmdb
20:25.360 server so this is where we will synchronize this via this service map
20:30.720 uh component that you might just be able to see on the cloud platform area and then we would synchronize that
20:36.960 information into abacus so it becomes a trusted source but other
20:42.559 items that are very useful for us such as the tco of applications that won't be source and
20:48.480 servicenow we have to get that by some other means and this is where um we're looking to
20:53.840 um connect to the uh cloud platforms api to pull that billing information in
20:59.280 there so we can get good financial data that can be used at the server level and aggregated up to k applications and then
206.080 to capabilities and in all of these um component types
211.280 to sort of raise the discussion about how do we improve and change this with we've used the
217.440 color coding uh attributes to show what's the data accuracy look like now what does it should it be
223.840 and the data completeness and this has been good to communicate
228.960 to say this is where we want to get to in order to make people come to
235.120 abacus as a good trusted source
241.000 No text
241.280 the cmdp process we adopted initially was to look at how the date the applications
246.640 was mastered in in one repository because they've been created separately
253.280 from how we would documents and
258.559 applications because its primary purpose is to be used for support and to create and
22:04.400 raise i.t service tickets they aren't the applications need to be
22:09.760 mapped slightly differently into um into what we would call applications and
22:16.480 i think this is a i think this is a reasonable thing to do there's maybe always an element of
22:21.600 transformation um based on the use cases or the purpose of that source system
22:27.280 so we created a script that looked at a particular attribute here we've got application import mapping type and decided is this
22:35.840 should this be a application component that sits in a parent application um should it be ignored completely
22:42.240 because it's just a business service um and one or two other attributes and
22:47.520 that way we have a good clean hazard architecture that can still be traced back to its source
22:53.280 information and then understood what mode of synchronization
22:59.760 happens between it and using the cmdb identifier which is a guide to uniquely
23:06.799 identify that component should we ever want to look back to that sort of system also in identifying where there are
23:12.880 discrepancies where we should think they should be changed at source this is a group this was a great opportunity to be able to do
23:18.240 that because we then had a list of applications and modules and to go and then go back
23:23.600 to the cdb owner to then challenge or to change what that all that data should look like
23:34.000 No text
23:34.840 so how did we look or approach the uh repository maturity there's a
23:41.919 number of use cases that we identified in the initial selection criteria and i think there's it was certainly a
23:48.640 journey we were definitely still all very much on that journey to look at maturing
23:53.679 the the the areas and the use cases of uh because where it could be used in
23:58.960 within end star to start with um the architecture team
24:05.760 um has a number of consumers that we work on projects solution architectures uh tuition architects work on with the
24:12.240 projects and there's it exec and there's other business execs and we want to create
24:18.000 solution architecture we do platform reviews um we were able to share technical debt
24:23.440 able to help in strategic decisions and help acquisitions and the benefits
24:29.919 here wanted to to show and to quantify what the benefits are in order to bring
24:36.000 that data together i think there's with all of these as a journey from simple awareness to
24:42.080 to show to uh for example exact same business exec so this is all very nice to actually adopt
24:47.919 in it and for them to want to come to us to actually get this to get this information and i think this all comes
24:53.520 back to the quality trying to get the quality of the data in there to show that they can trust the the the architecture
25:00.880 team and up and up abacus is a trusted source um so then that maturity then gets
25:08.400 raised so because wrong may be adopted to an embedded process
25:15.600 and for business analysts we are doing that right now so we're now extending the use of abacus outside of
25:22.480 core architecture team and business analysts are now starting to to utilize it for um
25:28.240 as is analysis or on project analysis to look at the 2b
25:33.520 and the benefits of this is is sort of described it can now dovetail exactly to our
25:39.679 capability maps to understand what that scope what what does that project scope look like
25:46.720 and it ultimately will reduce analysis time in future projects
25:53.679 the finance management this is what we are starting to really want to
26:00.080 go beyond from awareness to adoption now is is to take that information take the financial information from our
26:07.120 cloud provider and then we're able to um map those tcos from the servers to the capabilities and
26:13.679 business units and this is and then an opportunity um for finance management to then look at and identify
26:19.520 uh future cost savings i'll be from a purely environment server level
26:26.240 uh looking at efficiencies across there or in terms of run costs or licensing costs or looking at all
26:33.600 whole capabilities how to optimize the costs across a capability
26:39.760 and for the data governance this is something that we are um on track now we've we have an
26:46.960 existing um the data data lineage and data glossary application and we have
26:54.960 data stewards who now own own the data within nstar
27:00.240 and and this is now a great tool to take that information from that existing
27:06.080 tool and to start to embed that within the ea repository to become a single source of truth
27:14.159 and that then bridges the the gaps between it supported or the the data between it supported system
27:20.799 and data that sits outside of those supported systems in excel or some other um or
27:28.640 access databases or other files that's that that are out there in the wild so it's a good way to bring
27:34.159 the two together so we can then have proper informed decisions about um
27:39.360 target states um and driving future projects
27:45.760 one area we've not really looked at yet is the risk of compliance is um but i think it could be of benefit
27:52.320 is to um start to document um cyber or disaster recovery risks and
27:58.559 how those could be measured against technical debt and other components in in the repository
28:04.480 and then maybe to look at whole different controls that can be used and recorded and measured against those it services
28:13.000 No text
28:13.840 so the approach to building out the content um it's like where where's where to start is always always the biggest one of the biggest
28:19.679 questions i think it's to this diagram here just to sort of
28:24.720 illustrate a way to look at it um is to start thinking about in order
28:29.840 to answer some questions um how many component types do you need in order to answer that question
28:36.799 um here it's described as the breadth the depth here is how much coverage do
28:42.240 you need per component type how many how accurate and complete does the data need to be before it becomes useful and
28:48.960 trusted and obviously the the wider it is and
28:54.159 the deeper it is the longer it it takes to create that content
28:59.919 so when starting out and i'll just i've got a number of examples here
29:05.360 it's it's easy and it's one of one things that we did is to look at a conceptual target state architecture
29:11.600 you don't need many existing components to describe what that can look like and again this this is also this is already a useful
29:18.880 um diagram and tool uh to convey um and then we can start looking at um
29:26.480 as is models in a given domain we use this for the financial transformation program
29:34.320 and capabilities and value stream mappings um that requires just a couple of component
29:40.559 types but when you start to bring in the data from another data source that has a rich
29:47.120 complete set of data such as cmgb to provide information such as technical debt then the depth of that coverage
29:53.440 increases and then you're able to do more things such as the the data lineage between um supported
29:59.440 systems and non-supported systems and ultimately things like capability and mapping that
30:04.559 to the applications and mapping that to to the servers
30:14.880 so these are things i've sort of listed to sort of watch out for it's it's it's i think as any um
30:22.240 repository starts to mature and there's more content being produced
30:27.360 there's also a lot more gotchas to make sure that it doesn't become another graveyard of information so
30:34.640 when content is not validated or it can't be trusted is is one concern it might just be
30:40.080 created for a point of interest for one particular discussion point but then it might become out of date
30:46.000 very quickly or there's there's no ownership of that content after it's been created so people lose sight of what that purpose
30:52.480 of the diagram was can can we use it at all for anything else um there could be multiple copies of
30:59.120 similar diagrams within the same architecture
304.559 or worse still when emails when there's been copies of of the diagram that's
311.120 been downloaded and emailed to senior stakeholders and their and their information their
316.240 basis of information is on that particular version which might not be the final version of the version that is is sourced and
321.840 mastered in in in in the repository it could be multiple sub architectures
328.320 so people creating 2b architectures or or their own workspaces that aren't
334.559 synchronized up and become out of date and there could be and when there are
339.919 content authors outside of the core architecture team which is something i think any maturity
345.279 curve should should do is how to manage and curate that contents that's been driven do they
350.559 have different ideas of what what what the data types should be within well what the content should be
356.000 within a particular component type so it's understanding what things could be done to to
32:01.360 to harmonize the data the crowds the crowdsourcing approach of the data coming from multiple different sources
32:10.960 so one of the things we've done and i think it is early stages for us is to is to look at ways to improve that
32:16.799 so we we put in a very light search control framework within uh within our ear repository
32:23.039 where we have a number of high level categories that have um associated diagrams and
32:29.440 dashboards and to subjectively um identify what their accuracy and completeness is
32:35.519 when it was last checked so the idea of this is to is to provide a data source owner
32:43.440 um to make sure that they are responsible for these areas we have regular sessions we have a
32:49.440 bi-weekly purely just housekeeping to go through um the repository to identify um
32:56.240 which of these areas is out of date or which of these areas needs to be checked um and to
33:03.679 and to refresh those where there might be multiple sub architectures are redundant and can be
33:10.240 deleted uh or copies of diagrams that within the same architecture that could be
33:15.279 removed as well so we're trying to clean up as we go along so far that's been pretty good i think
33:22.799 we we can do more around the the the meta models the controls in the order control process
33:29.440 so we can go further where we maybe timestamp the individual diagrams and have them listed in another catalog
33:35.519 like this and to really identify where we think diagrams are not used or out of date
33:48.640 so things that we have done we can currently answer and show within um within the tool
33:56.559 so we we can do the itt run so we can we we have taken we haven't got real time synchronization but we
34:03.279 um but from manual imports we are able to look at the it run cost and aggregate that across servers and
34:10.079 applications capability and we have some very good high level and detailed level
34:16.879 solution diagrams and process flow diagrams in our finance systems and some detailed process flow diagrams
34:24.719 in our seeded reinsurance systems we're able to share the application roadmap in terms of invest tolerated
34:31.679 migrate we've used it to do a very thorough and detailed major business transition
34:36.800 um showing detailed business architecture steps and what that transition looks like
34:43.359 we can show the technical debt so we can show which operating the operating systems are running on which servers and then can identify
34:50.719 which applications those are related to to help provide it forecast and budget for future years
34:57.280 we have a very good detailed uh n-style capability model now and we also have a detailed organization
35:03.520 to portfolio diagram model
35:09.119 so the following slides is just looking at a few specific use cases that we've used
35:10.000 No text
35:15.680 abacus for so initiative we said earlier this year to identify
35:20.720 where we could implement solutions at low cost where there could be significant savings
35:26.640 in an otherwise manually intensive process typically we were looking at
35:32.160 projects that would only take two to four weeks so current debt management capability
35:38.320 within the seated ri space is is is a problem that we that was identified
35:44.560 particularly around query analysis and that's what the process we have with reinsurance with money
35:49.839 zones or disputes and we used abacus to measure what that capability performance looked like
35:58.560 and then using the tool able to then create a target state architecture in this case
36:04.640 it was using powerapps and power bi to look at automation of this and then we were able to
36:10.240 implement a solution in the racial space of time and then immediately show
36:15.839 where those systems improvements were through that automation process so they were very this was a very good
36:22.960 and effective way to um annotate the capabilities with effectiveness ratings
36:29.200 so that we can look at short-term wins where we know there are deficiencies
36:35.839 in some of the capabilities within n-star
36:41.000 No text
36:42.000 another use case is cost analysis as we described we have here from left to right the
36:48.000 total server costs across a number of applications and immediately there you can drill down
36:54.480 into what those costs are especially sort of in the top five and to see you know is it environment
37:01.359 specific is it licenses um is it other factors that contribute
37:07.200 to a high cost that we might want to
37:12.240 reduce so we're able to do that very well within the tool just with our integration into into cmdb um
37:20.800 we wanted to take this further where we could look at bau support costs and then measure um put tcos against
37:28.640 head count across it support and business support as well so that would help in future cases where
37:35.440 we're looking at key strategic decisions in terms of the organization drivers
37:40.880 where they want to go next with with certain parts of the business
37:46.000 No text
37:46.800 and another good use case is that the data lineage and business glossary piece so uh as i mentioned earlier we
37:54.400 have a power we have a report we have power bi that's produced
37:59.760 that produces um glossary and lineage information and that information is currently
38:06.400 separate from applicants we want to now integrate that so we can have that combined view
38:13.839 and do it but we don't need to change the reports those can still be used
38:20.800 across other key users who find our particular view useful so through
38:26.400 the abacus api we're still able to produce these types of reports where we can
38:33.040 still show business glossary information and the data lineage information we can
38:38.640 show here the for instance we have a decomposition tree where we've got the lineage from the
38:44.079 ultimate source to the ultimate or the ultimate child to the ultimate parents in terms of what what does the
38:49.760 data flow look like between all of the different steps and by using using the api
38:57.280 through the data source query and we were able to do that
39:04.000 No text
39:05.359 in the case of the major transformation program that sub best part a few years
39:12.960 is there were lots of projects that were happening concurrently around different instances of
39:18.160 some key systems that we were implementing across the eu in the us there was no one single
39:26.320 they all had different stakeholders so it's very confusing to understand to um business ex exactly what does that
39:33.520 solution landscape look like and what does the impact look like across all of the different regions we were
39:40.320 also we decided to annotate the application component type to show
39:45.520 where is the new development or where there was production changes it was in production but it was undergoing changes or it was live but
39:52.240 there was no changes at all this this key insight was very useful
39:57.680 to show um to all um project teams and and finance and cfos
40:04.880 to show what those interdependencies look like for those applications and how they
40:11.359 and how they were developed within the projects
40:17.000 No text
40:17.440 another use case was looking at the organizational mapping this helped um companies acquisitions
40:26.000 accompany divestment plans where we wanted to show how the applications
40:31.359 are serving which capabilities and which organizations which you see on the x-axis here um
40:38.640 are owned by own which applications so we can see this complex matrix this
40:43.839 actually helps provide that key information when there are company divestments or acquisitions
40:49.839 and what does that system landscape change look like
40:57.000 No text
40:57.040 so the application roadmap for us um so we've done quite a lot already in in
402.400 the uh i think it's one year now since since we since we purchased the tool and we have
407.920 um more things planned um in 2021 and beyond um so for business
414.480 architecture we're looking at the um we want to do more performance metrics we wanted
419.599 to do more subjective analysis on um the capability maps and business unit
426.640 to application mapping and drill down to level twos and level three capabilities
431.680 um for solution architecture that has now become an embedded process
436.880 but we want to onboard a lot of the existing work that we've done such as the existing enterprise assessment
443.280 diagrams and matrices that we've done manually in powerpoint for example um to continue the bpm
449.440 process diagrams to get more of the ba community using this so it becomes an embedded
454.880 process as well on the data architecture stream um we have uh our master
42:02.800 reference data models in in in the system we're able to show what that source of target looked
42:08.079 like across all the different um applications and now we're looking and planning to
42:13.599 introduce and implement the data glossary and the data lineage information in there as well
42:19.680 for integration automation um so as i mentioned we want to integrate our cloud service information get the
42:27.280 service map and cost monitoring information into there as well and to provide any um outputs into into bi into power bi as
42:35.200 we use reporting tools um so they could be shown in multiple ways to
42:42.000 different audiences and for metrics say we wanted to bring
42:48.400 in more vendor information more real-time information from the new vendor management system
42:53.599 and this is with a view that we could potentially ultimately replace our current bi finance bi solution against saving money
43:00.640 and reducing complexity of these services and for the adoption we say we're using
43:07.119 it um extensively in project architecture um we're starting to use it in um in
43:14.319 discussions around business architecture and transition models we want to do more with acquisitions um
43:21.040 to provide more useful information for target state scenarios and to use it embed the process in 90
43:27.200 financial planning and key it strategic planning and ultimately business plan

01.920 foreign
06.359 so first of all I'm just before jumping
09.000 into some of the actual content um it's
11.099 worth a quick slide on who we are as a
14.340 company and you've heard my bio there
16.560 from Oliver but evolution really is the
19.980 supplier of the Abacus EA tool
23.160 um so we're a leader in this particular
24.600 market and we have users all across the
27.420 world across many different countries
29.400 and therefore we also have offices
31.560 around the world to support our users as
33.719 well
34.739 you can see that we've been doing this
36.600 for for a number of different years now
38.640 um for a few years I've been here for
40.440 close to 10 of those 21 years
44.520 um and certainly one of the things
45.960 you'll see on here as well at the bottom
47.760 is the support that we have the types of
50.780 Frameworks notations methodologies all
55.320 of those kind of accelerators if you
58.440 like that can help various Enterprise
000.600 Architects to build content within their
003.239 EA tools
007.520 standard 10th edition of course is what
009.840 we'll be focusing on today and but we
011.640 will touch partly on some of the other
013.619 notations and Frameworks as well just
016.380 give you a bit of an idea of how that's
018.119 going to be supported and in the tool
021.119 so here we go Road mapping using the the
023.159 tokaf standard so roadmapping itself
027.060 um is something that I've seen of course
029.159 many of our organizations wanting to use
031.680 and the various customers that we work
033.780 with whether that's from universities
036.619 Finance non-profits
039.240 everyone I speak to wants a roadmap and
042.420 arguably it's because it provides some
044.640 kind of element of direction of where
046.500 they are headed
047.700 it's true whether those are technology
050.340 roadmaps business roadmaps portfolio
052.860 road maps they are there to provide some
055.920 kind of direction if you like for the
059.220 company for project teams
02:01.680 um or just for individual users within
02:03.299 the organization as well
02:05.399 Enterprise architecture I guess has
02:07.740 helped develop these types of roadmaps
02:10.380 and as you can see the bottom hopefully
02:12.900 provider brings some levels of assurance
02:14.520 of risk management as well
02:16.620 being able to understand where we are
02:18.540 where we want to get to becomes a
02:21.180 fundamental part of those roadmaps
02:24.720 so there are a few different uses of
02:26.459 these and certainly uses that we've seen
02:28.379 across organizations and so certainly
02:31.379 for let's say financial institutions and
02:34.680 we've seen these used for Regulatory
02:36.959 Compliance I'm a few a few years back
02:39.840 when standards like method 2 came in and
02:42.540 organizations wanted to make sure that
02:44.340 they could be compliant and certainly
02:46.440 when they're standard became a standard
02:48.720 that they actually were compliant so
02:51.480 these roadmaps provide a really
02:52.980 effective way of doing that
02:54.860 the key thing there is usually it's some
02:57.660 level of
02:59.180 scoring that you might apply to road
03:01.620 maps as well you may 80 compliant today
03:04.560 we want to be 85 in the next 12 months
03:07.620 so it's those types of situations that
03:10.019 they become quite useful
03:12.540 also things like M A's so mergers and
03:15.360 Acquisitions especially when
03:17.400 organizations are trying to adopt
03:19.440 Technologies from who they're merging
03:21.360 from or acquiring from these roadmaps
03:24.120 provide a really nice formal and
03:26.159 standardized way of actually managing
03:28.560 those time frames as well
03:30.659 you can see a few other let's say use
03:33.180 cases or drivers on here as well but I
03:35.700 think pretty much everyone recall would
03:37.620 hopefully have some
03:39.659 um let's say experience of of producing
03:42.599 road maps or wanting to produce roadmaps
03:44.700 and it's certainly what we hear most of
03:46.620 the time when we speak to our customers
03:50.400 so what does a standard actually do and
03:52.980 why would we actually use a standard
03:55.980 well hopefully by definition of its name
03:58.080 it does provide a good standardized way
04:00.720 of producing content a lot of the time
04:03.440 so from our perspective what this really
04:06.120 means is we can have pre-configured
04:08.340 content
04:09.659 so we can actually have an example
04:12.299 roadmaps example dashboards example
04:14.819 reports of maybe what good looks like
04:18.060 four different Industries and different
04:20.040 organizations as well
04:22.440 a lot of these Frameworks and
04:24.060 specifically of course together in this
04:25.620 case also provides a method you know if
04:29.040 we look at something like the ADM we can
04:31.320 see where there are aspects of that
04:33.060 particular standard where we can build
04:34.979 those roadmaps and apply those so the
04:37.860 methodology of how to do something is
04:40.620 also a part of those standards
04:43.860 The Meta model itself and what we might
04:46.380 classify as a meta model is essentially
04:48.780 the list of components or the objects
04:51.479 and then the connections the
04:53.160 relationships between those objects and
04:56.160 that's really the fundamental aspects
04:58.440 when we start producing roadmaps
05:01.440 typically if we think of Technology
05:04.080 roadmaps and product roadmaps and
05:06.000 business roadmaps they all use aspects
05:08.639 from that meta model but also let's say
05:11.400 generic EA roadmaps we arguably want
05:14.460 some kind of slice through the entire
05:16.500 architecture as well
05:18.479 what processes do we have
05:20.699 which applications support those what
05:22.919 infrastructure is in place what
05:24.419 regulations are they abiding by that's
05:27.240 really where the meta model can help
05:28.800 Define the aspects of your roadmap as
05:31.440 well
05:32.580 and finally like we've mentioned already
05:34.220 templates and notations the style of the
05:37.560 views that you create the style of the
05:39.419 roadmaps that you produce
05:41.100 we'll touch on this a bit more towards
05:42.840 the end but it's certainly a key aspect
05:45.240 of those Frameworks
05:47.580 now it's not just limited to the open
05:49.080 group Frameworks of course as much as
05:50.520 this as an open group WebEx and you
05:52.199 likely want to combine these with other
05:53.520 areas as well and hence the tool support
05:56.460 that we have we're relatively agnostic
05:58.440 of Standards our ability is to support
06:01.020 them and obviously then combining them
06:03.900 with other notations if needed
06:07.620 and we do have experts on the call which
06:10.020 which isn't me um who can tell you a bit
06:12.419 more in terms of the certification
06:13.740 process so hopefully we'll get some
06:15.060 questions at the end about this but you
06:17.160 can see how quickly togaf of course has
06:19.020 been adopted worldwide and these stats
06:21.360 are maybe a couple of years old now and
06:23.580 but you can see the influence it has you
06:25.800 can see again why it's become a standard
06:27.720 and you can also see why users are
06:30.060 actually using this across the world
06:31.979 okay it actually produces some really
06:34.620 good outputs and deliverables it's a
06:37.199 good methodology to adopt even if you're
06:39.360 just starting off in the Eva world and
06:42.419 you can see that there's a huge
06:43.800 community and resource to access
06:46.860 and that's I would arguably say one of
06:49.440 the the key or fundamental things of
06:51.539 thinking of standards and Frameworks is
06:53.759 is there a community an audience you can
06:56.160 reach out to a body that you can speak
06:57.840 to to actually ask your questions and
07:00.180 get some answers in return
07:02.160 clearly you can see that obviously togaf
07:04.259 is is right up there as one of those
07:08.400 now Telegraph itself when we think about
07:10.740 road maps and we can also think of this
07:13.139 as almost different business scenarios
07:15.000 as well quite often when we see
07:18.120 customers building roadmaps
07:20.280 can be for points in time
07:22.860 so a roadmap typically has a time
07:25.199 element to it and but really if you
07:27.240 think of these as different business
07:28.560 scenarios and different roadmaps to
07:30.840 achieve those
07:32.340 so again Telegraph of course has
07:34.199 elements that contribute towards this
07:36.840 where we first look at the three aspects
07:39.539 of building business scenarios we gather
07:42.539 the information we analyze that and then
07:45.180 ideally we kind of review and
07:46.740 collaborate on that content as well
07:49.440 so these are typical phases to remember
07:51.780 when you are looking to build roadmaps
07:54.419 using something like Telegram
07:57.960 but what really is a roadmap well I
08:00.599 guess the first thing we can think of is
08:02.039 a definition
08:03.120 and so of course the togaf standard does
08:06.300 have a definition for what a roadmap is
08:08.220 but from reality of course what this
08:10.740 really means is we're looking at change
08:12.840 over time
08:14.340 now this could be months it could be
08:16.139 years it could also be across the
08:19.020 lifespan of different projects or
08:20.340 programs that you're running
08:22.020 and of course from an Enterprise
08:23.400 architecture perspective it usually
08:26.099 incorporates different aspects like
08:27.900 people processes and Technology as well
08:31.319 now you can of course get these
08:33.000 specialized roadmaps technology ones
08:35.580 architecture ones again usually they're
08:38.159 they're kind of certain parts of the
08:40.140 overall architectural landscape and
08:43.320 again of course if you're going to be
08:44.580 using something like the togaf standard
08:46.380 you typically will be splitting those up
08:49.080 potentially into those business
08:51.120 scenarios
08:54.480 now when we do actually think from a
08:56.339 standard perspective then we can think
08:58.320 of the terminology that's used in here
09:00.120 so when we think of things like work
09:01.800 package portfolios and typically maybe
09:04.320 projects and programs that we're working
09:06.000 on we might try to assess and review
09:09.120 those so what kind of business value do
09:11.880 they bring maybe what risk is associated
09:13.980 to those but this is a fundamental part
09:16.800 of why we would produce a roadmap in the
09:18.660 first place to actually get a view of
09:20.940 those
09:22.140 so you can take this kind of Matrix
09:23.940 based approach and to actually analyze
09:26.640 some of the projects and programs that
09:28.080 you have and then use that as an input
09:30.779 for your roadmaps but also from an
09:33.480 output perspective as well
09:36.120 I mentioned where agnostic of Frameworks
09:38.640 technically from a tool perspective from
09:40.740 in terms of abacus's tool set
09:43.860 um but certainly the way we typically
09:45.180 think of this and maybe this is the the
09:47.760 Practical side of what we've seen from
09:49.440 our experience
09:50.640 is we typically split these roadmaps
09:53.760 into four different styles if you like
09:57.120 so there's type one in here is typically
09:59.700 what we would have as a tagging approach
10:02.940 so if we heat map our diagrams our views
10:06.779 the suggestion in there for what we're
10:08.940 actually using as a heat map maybe
10:11.100 something like a Time concept so
10:13.260 tolerate invest migrate eliminate or any
10:15.660 other kind of classification system
10:17.100 you're using just to understand what's
10:20.640 being changed
10:22.560 type 2 is usually more of a let's say
10:25.980 traditional time aspect where there's a
10:27.959 time scale and there's life cycle dates
10:30.480 we're thinking of we're also thinking of
10:32.279 when this change is going to happen
10:35.339 and type 3 incorporates more of those
10:37.380 work packages projects and programs and
10:39.779 some of the interdependencies across the
10:41.880 model
10:42.660 okay so producing application roadmaps
10:45.420 typically maybe type 1 or type two type
10:48.839 three then is actually the connections
10:51.240 across the model
10:52.920 if we're retiring applications which
10:55.620 processes capabilities and
10:57.120 infrastructure does that affect so it's
10:59.399 using that EA model and then spanning
101.560 across the organization
104.079 and type 4 the final type in here is
106.420 what we classify as multiple
107.980 architectures coming back to Telegraph
110.200 as a business scenario concept where we
112.839 actually want to build potentially
114.220 trade-off views
116.079 for the multiple states that we're
117.700 modeled
119.200 dive into a few examples of what these
121.480 look like later on but think of these as
123.820 the four types
125.440 and arguably over time maybe there's a
127.779 data maturity aspect to which type you
130.180 want to produce and or also on the
133.240 audience you're producing that for as
134.920 well
136.420 so again those standards become really
138.160 useful and of course the idea is to
140.380 reuse those standards we're not actually
142.240 Reinventing the wheel and we can
144.040 actually maximize the value of the data
146.260 that's there
147.899 maximizing the value of that data is of
150.579 course one of the the fundamental parts
152.260 of the the kind of Concepts they work
154.480 with on customers
156.579 when we think of roadmaps and we
159.160 typically think that it does require a
12:00.839 lot of data and arguably you do want
12:03.540 that's as close to real time as possible
12:07.140 so again maximizing the value of your
12:09.779 data from this perspective is sharing
12:12.959 the content you produce
12:14.660 leveraging automation so bringing data
12:17.579 into tools or into any kind of portfolio
12:20.040 you're using and then making sure that
12:22.620 there is let's say real-time views
12:25.440 if you're producing a road map for the
12:27.480 next six months you want to be using the
12:30.060 best available data and not data that's
12:32.100 maybe two or three years old
12:35.820 and then of course some of the
12:37.140 fundamental fundamental elements of a
12:38.880 roadmap which I think uh are relatively
12:41.100 evident from from what we've said so far
12:43.560 um but roadmaps typically start off from
12:45.180 where you are
12:46.560 um typically you want to then be at a
12:48.540 certain point or reach a certain
12:50.399 destination
12:51.720 and then really what we're trying to do
12:53.459 through those roadmaps is explain how we
12:56.459 actually get there and why we actually
12:58.560 want to get there
13:00.480 the why becomes again a really important
13:03.540 aspect of roadmaps and we don't
13:05.639 necessarily want to produce some the
13:07.860 sake of producing them there has to be
13:10.019 some fundamental goal at the end
13:12.600 are we trying to reach level of
13:14.220 compliance we want to reduce our
13:16.620 application costs are we looking to
13:19.440 redevelop our processes there's usually
13:22.500 a why to those types of roadmaps as well
13:26.459 I've mentioned it does typically require
13:28.860 a lot of data and there are things of
13:31.500 course that we can do to help streamline
13:33.240 that
13:34.440 the key thing is actually
13:36.740 managing this in chunks let's say so we
13:40.560 can break down what aspects from a
13:43.079 roadmap we actually need to produce
13:45.740 realistically for most organizations it
13:48.300 does mean getting multiple teams
13:49.860 involved
13:51.240 and of course that means then sharing
13:53.160 the data and building more modular
13:55.440 architecture areas and so that each team
13:58.500 can actually work on the area that they
14:00.300 are responsible for
14:02.279 so we can petition the architecture
14:04.740 Telegraph has some really good examples
14:06.480 of how to do this whether we go for
14:08.700 breadth or depth depending on the
14:10.260 roadmaps we're producing making sure
14:12.540 that we focus on the expertise within
14:14.459 the organization and most importantly
14:17.519 that everyone's actually working at the
14:19.380 same time on this content and that we're
14:21.720 not working in separate disparate tools
14:24.420 okay so certainly I've seen from my
14:27.180 experience siled data sets which
14:31.380 I guess we can cross our fingers come
14:33.000 together in the end it really happens
14:36.240 um you do need to make sure that there
14:37.620 is some kind of single source that you
14:39.240 can trust and then hopefully a single
14:41.820 deliverable and output from that source
14:43.860 as well
14:46.260 a quick example
14:47.940 um maybe for what I mean by typical
14:49.620 automated views and the kind of life
14:51.959 cycle stages I mentioned for type 2
14:53.820 roadmaps this is really the kind of life
14:56.399 cycle stages we think about
14:58.620 um start dates end dates and the vendor
15:01.019 support you know this is where we can
15:03.060 actually build
15:04.560 dare I say more traditional Road mapping
15:07.440 approaches gun style views is typically
15:10.320 what people think of when we say road
15:12.000 maps
15:13.320 um like I said it doesn't always have to
15:14.639 be but this can be one of the first
15:16.560 things that we actually achieve and from
15:19.079 using any tool really
15:23.160 and then there's the aspect of what
15:25.860 we've called No code algorithms so
15:29.220 roadmaps require a lot of data
15:31.699 typically we can automate that as much
15:33.899 as we can and one of the ways to
15:36.240 actually automate that is to leverage
15:38.940 let's say formulas or no code based
15:42.000 algorithms
15:43.320 what that means we're a practical
15:44.820 perspective
15:46.139 is all of different types of components
15:48.600 that we're modeling within the
15:49.740 architecture applications capabilities
15:52.500 infrastructure processes all have sets
15:55.680 of attributes that we want to manage
15:57.839 so whether these are business fits and
16:00.060 Technical fit scores the criticality of
16:03.000 our systems the cost of our systems
16:05.639 we want to leverage some of the no code
16:08.040 capabilities of tools
16:10.320 and that's because we want to actually
16:12.000 dive into some of the insights from that
16:13.980 data
16:15.360 okay so algorithms really can provide a
16:18.600 way of predicting some of the future
16:20.579 States even without you actually
16:22.740 producing them manually
16:25.079 specifically when we think about
16:26.459 application Landscapes that can become
16:28.860 quite important if we want to try and
16:31.139 predict what our costs are going to be
16:32.639 in the next six months predict the
16:34.980 complexity increases from an m a
16:37.620 these are where these no code algorithms
16:39.720 become really useful
16:41.940 the outputs from these can also dictate
16:44.160 the roadmap
16:45.600 you know if we're running an algorithm
16:47.100 that determines the availability of our
16:49.259 services is relatively low for the
16:51.839 reliability of our services is
16:53.600 relatively low that can hopefully them
16:57.480 um let's say kick off a a project to
17:01.380 produce road maps for remedying those
17:03.600 types of situations as well
17:08.040 when I looked at those four types and I
17:10.380 also mentioned a Type 4 which is these
17:13.020 multiple architectures and from a I'm
17:16.260 going to say traditional EA sense I'm a
17:18.660 diagramming capability format let's say
17:21.720 what we really think about here are
17:23.160 things like current states and future
17:24.419 States
17:25.439 okay so if you've used things like
17:27.240 argument for example you might recognize
17:29.400 these as plateaus and business scenarios
17:32.100 in togaf but the idea is that we have
17:34.679 some kind of Baseline model and then we
17:37.080 actually want to produce some Target
17:38.940 States and you can see this of course
17:40.860 with the ADM and phase b as well we're
17:43.380 actually trying to understand what we
17:44.880 could look like through these different
17:46.440 scenarios
17:48.360 they don't always have to be end States
17:50.220 either and keep in mind these could
17:52.320 actually be transition States phases of
17:54.960 a project they certainly can be Target
17:57.539 States but they also could be those
18:00.620 interim phases that we actually go to to
18:03.240 reach those scenarios
18:05.700 later on and I'll touch on a bit more
18:07.799 around the trade-off of why we actually
18:10.140 model different scenarios but from a
18:12.480 practical perspective these are maybe
18:14.960 views that you're currently producing
18:17.160 certainly as much as it's on anonymized
18:19.260 data in here certainly views that some
18:21.179 of our customers are producing
18:23.280 um for building current states and
18:24.780 Target States as well
18:30.660 so Road mapping and hopefully we've
18:32.520 covered in a bit of detail there again
18:33.960 we'll jump on to some of the other
18:35.220 topics later on on some of the details
18:37.860 but another fundamental aspect that
18:40.020 we've seen as a practical guide for EAS
18:42.539 and certainly one of the trends we've
18:44.220 seen
18:45.059 um is around technical debt
18:47.520 and we've provided extensive webex's
18:49.500 before on technical debt
18:51.600 um but I think Telegraph has a really
18:52.919 nice um quote within their standard in
18:55.080 here which is today's digital products
18:57.900 um inevitably in my case and I've seen
19:00.539 um do become tomorrow's technical debt
19:03.419 now technical debt itself stems from a
19:07.440 few different areas I mean originally of
19:09.480 course more from a software perspective
19:11.340 where we have
19:13.620 um maybe refractoring code if we
19:16.140 actually look purely from a software
19:17.700 perspective whether terminology came
19:19.320 from and that's important in most
19:21.840 organizations
19:23.240 where maybe kind of
19:26.460 the the terminology to be me more kind
19:28.919 of Enterprise there it's or
19:30.660 architectural debt
19:32.640 um certainly if you search the notograph
19:34.200 standard you'll find almost exactly the
19:36.360 same terminology of course
19:38.520 but the idea is that that follows
19:41.160 throughout the entire organization
19:44.220 um certainly from an EA perspective
19:45.900 we're not just focusing on software in
19:47.820 this case and we are focusing on the
19:50.039 architecture as a whole
19:52.799 most of the time it's not necessarily
19:55.860 the case
19:57.120 um that it's it's a bad thing to have
19:59.220 technical debt so we've grouped this
20:01.799 into what we call reasonable and
20:03.299 negligent debt
20:05.100 for a lot of the products we build onto
20:07.260 the projects We Run The reasonable debt
20:09.840 typically falls into maybe where we have
20:11.700 time constraints
20:13.140 and we will issue some waivers now to
20:15.539 push a product out because we realize
20:17.880 the benefits outweigh the time and cost
20:20.039 it would take to fix immediately
20:22.860 sometimes there's a need for debt
20:24.960 because we do have plans to refactor
20:27.000 things later on as well
20:28.559 okay so this is typically what we might
20:30.240 call reasonable debt
20:32.100 now negligent of course is the stuff we
20:34.200 want to avoid hopefully
20:36.240 um short-term patches to products that
20:38.340 we know aren't ready for release
20:41.059 poorly Integrated Systems and services
20:44.179 and hopefully stuff we avoid the most
20:46.559 but we the lack of planning can
20:48.539 typically fall into negligent debt as
20:50.400 well
20:51.480 stuff which
20:52.980 I realize in practice isn't easy to
20:55.559 avoid but sometimes it's good to realize
20:58.200 that of course not All Tech debt that we
200.000 build up is necessarily a case of bad
202.340 planning it could just because we know
204.440 we have plans in the future to refactor
206.900 something for example
210.860 um there was an interesting stat here as
212.299 well 25 of the overall development time
214.520 is dedicated to managing technical debt
217.340 um and that arguably is because we've
220.100 historically tried to push products out
222.500 and projects out
224.299 um
224.900 so quickly to hit Market first that
227.900 we've accepted the overall cost that
230.659 it's going to take to fix in the future
232.880 again I've said it's not always about
234.860 and the bad thing about technical debts
237.799 generally
239.539 is diabetically invisible
242.659 so most EAS hopefully like some kind of
244.880 classification framework
246.620 um this one's actually from Fleet
247.760 Christian for this particular one is
250.159 useful
251.179 um so you can see here the the kind of
252.679 features that we might roll out as part
254.539 of products are typically
256.820 um visible to users and organizations
22:00.059 and stakeholders and I agree should
22:02.400 provide value whereas the bugs usually
22:05.940 visible but do obviously provide
22:08.280 negative value
22:10.559 um I think the architecture one
22:12.179 hopefully is a bit unfair these days it
22:13.799 certainly maybe was this case
22:15.720 um but architecture provides very
22:17.220 positive value to organizations arguably
22:20.100 is a bit more invisible to The Wider
22:22.559 team and of course Tech debt falling to
22:25.200 negative value and invisible so so the
22:27.960 worst really of where we can actually
22:29.640 land
22:31.140 interestingly though you know some of
22:33.539 the kind of content we produce from a
22:35.460 tech debt perspective is actually
22:37.140 visible to certain teams and we'll see a
22:40.200 quick view of that later as well of
22:41.580 who's actually aware of where Tech debt
22:43.440 sits
22:45.659 another good classification framework
22:47.520 just to show you
22:48.960 is this let's say time on a trade-off of
22:52.799 time cost and quality
22:54.840 okay so most of the time when we're
22:57.240 producing content and building products
22:59.280 let's say
23:00.299 um there's a trade-off
23:01.919 and typically if we think of
23:04.940 pushing quality down that's because we
23:07.500 want to do something very quickly
23:10.440 um and also we want to reduce the costs
23:13.440 the other side of that is actually want
23:15.720 to do something very
23:18.120 slowly or very quickly and there's a
23:20.640 compromise then to be made on cost and
23:22.799 quality
23:24.240 and then finally of course we have this
23:26.280 expensive approach you know we have to
23:28.620 be doing something very quickly it has
23:30.659 to be of high quality unlikely that
23:33.059 trade-off means it's going to be
23:34.620 relatively expensive
23:36.840 most organizations hopefully want to
23:39.840 find some kind of balance here and
23:42.419 between these three metrics but
23:45.000 inevitably there are going to be
23:46.980 trade-offs and in certain situations you
23:49.559 do want to push one boundary more than
23:51.360 the other depending on the product
23:53.100 you're working on
23:54.799 oftentimes I'm going to say time is the
23:58.260 thing that we can control least often
24:00.000 especially if we think of things like
24:01.980 technology roadmaps
24:03.780 um Ender Bender support dates for
24:06.000 example relatively fixed so we do
24:09.299 potentially have a good amount of time
24:11.760 to fix that but the nearer it gets the
24:14.159 more we might actually have to push
24:15.480 those costs up to do those things
24:17.100 quickly as well
24:20.280 now again I mentioned earlier on
24:22.380 technical debt came originally from a
24:24.240 software background and certainly from
24:25.980 what I've seen that's not the area that
24:27.840 we want to focus on from an organization
24:29.760 perspective we actually want to find
24:31.980 ways of classifying and measuring
24:34.500 technical debt in arguably a more
24:38.100 business-centric way
24:40.200 so the questions you can see on the
24:42.059 right hand side the typical kind of I
24:44.700 want to think of those are the the
24:45.780 pillars and zachman
24:47.580 um but really things like what
24:49.260 applications we use and what
24:50.520 technologies do they use that's a
24:52.799 fundamental part of classifying
24:55.200 technical debts initially
24:57.419 if applications using Auto support
24:59.460 Technologies
25:00.840 if they're using an unsupported
25:03.720 Technologies from an organizational
25:05.159 perspective where we have preferred ones
25:07.500 that we should be using that can
25:09.539 contribute to the overall Tech Net score
25:12.240 and then we want to identify who the
25:14.460 owners are so we can actually
25:15.480 collaborate on this and the why of
25:18.360 course is important here as well you
25:20.460 know we have to make business decisions
25:22.020 not necessarily technology decisions
25:23.880 business should drive technology
25:25.799 decisions ultimately
25:27.900 so classifying I'm measuring technical
25:30.480 debt and becomes incredibly important as
25:33.360 well
25:34.380 the impact of that can then lead into
25:37.260 things like higher level cost metrics or
25:40.080 security or a risk you know certainly
25:42.600 the conversations I have with certain
25:44.100 stakeholders when we talk about
25:46.140 technical debt we talk about the
25:47.880 implications regardless of how in-depth
25:51.480 and Technical we might get from an
25:52.980 architecture perspective we really want
25:55.140 to convey the fact that there is going
25:56.820 to be a cost implication if we don't fix
25:59.400 something now
26:00.840 or there's a higher risk to the services
26:03.059 and data that we hold if we don't fix
26:05.100 something now
26:06.360 so it's about trying to maybe translate
26:08.400 some more of the technical terms up to a
26:11.640 higher level business deliverable
26:14.220 outcome and typically cost drives most
26:17.159 decisions
26:18.240 um so cost is arguably a good place to
26:20.580 start
26:23.880 this is quickly just coming back to the
26:26.460 no code based approaches I talked about
26:28.500 earlier on so again algorithms are going
26:30.779 to be really useful in this situation
26:32.580 you know if we have metrics up and down
26:34.500 on the model we want to aggregate those
26:36.299 as quickly as we can we want to identify
26:39.059 Trends within the architecture and so
26:42.120 using algorithms becomes again you know
26:44.520 a very important aspect of building
26:46.500 these types of technical that scores but
26:50.279 also recommendations
26:52.380 now if we can have a tool that can
26:54.059 analyze our application portfolio and
26:56.940 can understand the criticality of our
27:00.120 applications the fact that using
27:01.919 unsupported technologies that tool in
27:04.860 this case Abacus can then actually
27:06.659 recommend what we should be doing
27:09.240 should we invest in this product should
27:11.279 we retire this product should we migrate
27:13.559 to new Services those the types of areas
27:16.260 the tool should help of course they're
27:18.179 not silver bullets it requires data it
27:20.340 requires input from Architects but those
27:22.740 algorithms can help shape some of those
27:24.960 decisions going on
27:27.840 ultimately it comes back to who actually
27:29.520 cares about this stuff so earlier on I
27:32.100 mentioned of course people within your
27:33.539 organization are aware of technical debt
27:36.960 um I may be unsurprisingly it's people
27:38.760 on the front line the delivery teams the
27:40.799 EAS
27:41.940 the difficulty is then working back
27:45.120 towards something like Senior Management
27:46.940 who potentially are very unaware of
27:50.100 technical debt
27:51.600 they may be aware that costs are
27:53.640 increasing in certain areas and risks
27:55.740 are increasing but it might not always
27:57.779 be tied back to Tech debt or Enterprise
27:59.820 debt
28:01.440 so again
28:02.700 part of why we'd actually want to work
28:04.799 within something like a tool and part of
28:06.600 why we'd actually want to use a standard
28:08.279 like togaf is to make sure that we have
28:11.340 everyone in the organization involved
28:13.919 if you look through the standard of
28:15.779 course there's mentions of Enterprise
28:16.860 Architects but there's mention of every
28:19.020 other team within the organization
28:21.360 and you can actually see that within
28:22.980 10th edition as well if you look at the
28:24.600 series guys that have been introduced
28:26.100 from from that perspective security
28:28.320 architecture project architecture
28:30.179 process architecture
28:31.980 it's the wider team being involved that
28:35.039 can actually help deliver these results
28:36.559 and it's not just a focus on the EA team
28:39.539 anymore
28:40.500 and arguably you know the EA team have
28:43.440 those capabilities within there but it's
28:45.900 making sure that the wider audience is
28:49.260 aware of the work that's going on and of
28:51.840 course an aware of some of the outputs
28:53.400 that are being delivered as well
28:56.700 so that comes to really the next phase
28:59.460 which is we have the data we potentially
29:01.620 produce some road maps and we have an
29:03.779 idea of how we're classifying measuring
29:05.700 technical debt and we can see why it's
29:07.559 important
29:08.580 we can also see who we actually need to
29:10.380 convince now to reduce Tech debt so
29:13.320 really that's about raising awareness
29:15.059 across the organization
29:17.400 so action and ownership is a key aspect
29:21.179 and I wish I don't think gets as much
29:24.179 emphasis
29:25.620 um or maybe certainly hasn't it
29:27.539 definitely has these days from the
29:29.039 customers we've worked with but action
29:30.960 and ownership means actually motivating
29:33.059 people to actually see the work that's
29:35.039 going on
29:36.240 okay
29:37.740 now from an EA perspective
29:40.740 um or from any team perspective really
29:42.419 the availability of the data is one of
29:45.120 the first things
29:46.679 so do we have the data yes how are we
29:50.399 making that visible to the rest of the
29:51.960 organization are we leveraging existing
29:54.659 tools that are in use
29:56.279 are we you know trying to develop our
29:58.200 own tools
29:59.760 the key thing is actually centralizing a
30:01.919 lot of that data
30:03.659 ownership means that people are going to
30:05.279 be more aware of their own content
30:06.980 ownership means that people can feel a
30:09.240 bit more comfortable reaching out to The
30:10.919 Wider team to ask questions about the
30:13.080 products and projects they're building
30:14.360 and it also allows us to actually track
30:16.860 some of the content that we're building
30:18.299 as well
30:19.559 I mean even here you can see even if
30:21.419 we're within a tool like abacus you want
30:24.779 to be able to integrate this with tools
30:26.520 that your end users are using teams
30:29.460 Confluence slack SharePoint make this
30:32.460 data available in those areas
30:34.980 so that we can then reuse it as
30:36.779 Architects within our own EA tool for
30:38.700 planning and Road mapping Etc
30:42.299 the other key aspect is actually having
30:45.000 a bit more of a focus on certain metrics
30:49.260 um some of these slides we produced
30:50.460 before has you know lists up hundreds of
30:53.039 metrics that we we want to to focus on
30:55.320 potentially and we always ask the
30:56.640 question which ones do you want to focus
30:58.380 on
30:59.700 um most of the time we get the answer of
302.039 all of them we all want to reduce costs
304.620 we want to increase efficiency we want
306.779 to make our services better and quicker
309.600 the problem is that we can't do all of
311.880 those things at once
313.559 and certainly the pitfalls or the quick
317.940 failures I've seen is maybe an over
321.240 emphasis on perfecting a model or trying
325.440 to implement too much too quickly
328.500 so my recommendation usually is find the
331.140 focus initially
332.820 again you know costs comes up every time
335.520 but really the focus could be on
337.799 specific products or programs that
339.659 you're running right now your focus
341.760 could be on a specific use case
343.159 internally we want to reduce Tech debt
345.539 or internally we are working on a cloud
347.880 migration project
349.500 so focusing on those areas becomes
351.980 fundamental for a successful EA
354.720 implementation in my opinion
358.020 and then finally from a communication
32:00.480 perspective it's actually trying to make
32:03.360 that data available through things like
32:04.799 interactive dashboards
32:06.840 PowerPoint slides PDFs are also okay but
32:10.679 realistically you won't need a real-time
32:13.919 data and your audience wants a bit more
32:16.440 of a self-service environment so it's
32:18.779 making sure that they can access that
32:20.520 content they can review they can provide
32:22.679 feedback then they can also feel like
32:25.140 they're actually interacting with that
32:27.059 content
32:28.320 this also has the the other effect of if
32:30.779 you ask someone for information they
32:32.220 usually want something in return so if
32:34.260 you're asking someone for which
32:35.640 applications they use which processes
32:37.679 they support it's nice that they can
32:40.140 actually dive into a dashboard and see
32:42.419 the outcome from content that they're
32:45.120 actually
32:46.860 um delivering them to you as an
32:48.720 architect as well
32:50.520 foreign
32:52.279 both of the things we talked about so
32:54.480 far so Road mapping technical debt
32:56.580 reduction
32:57.840 um a few quick things to mention in
32:59.580 terms of how we've actually managed this
33:01.020 across our organization and across our
33:03.059 customers organizations as well stuff
33:05.460 you've already seen so far but again
33:08.100 just re-emphasizing life cycles and
33:11.039 Gantt charts become really useful for
33:12.840 this because when we actually road map
33:15.179 Tech debt there has to be a level of
33:17.460 reduction over time we can't just say we
33:19.919 want to you know eliminate this because
33:21.919 one of the issues you'll find is you'll
33:24.659 always keep consistent scores of how
33:26.580 you're reducing Tech debt but maybe not
33:29.700 clear visibility on the new applications
33:32.340 that are being spun up the new
33:34.440 infrastructure that's involved new
33:35.940 capabilities your your building
33:37.860 internally that can be invisible Tech
33:40.799 debt that you don't see because you're
33:42.840 focused on a specific area
33:44.700 so making sure it's actually available
33:46.320 making sure you can actually Trace that
33:48.600 throughout the entire architecture this
33:51.059 end-to-end ecosystem if you like
33:54.120 um becomes really important
33:56.460 the other thing is coming back to that
33:58.320 tagging approach
33:59.820 right now you might be in a situation
34:01.620 where maybe there isn't a maybe a plan
34:03.840 of exactly how you're going to reduce
34:05.820 Tech debts or when so it's important to
34:08.520 just start with that tagging approach
34:10.260 you know what do we actually want to to
34:12.659 start with
34:13.679 should we start with those applications
34:15.659 that could be moved to Cloud
34:17.879 should we just start with those
34:19.320 applications that highly critical
34:21.359 or should we just start with those
34:23.159 applications that maybe actually don't
34:25.379 have that many users so the impact of
34:27.899 migration will be less there are
34:29.940 different avenues that you can go down
34:31.560 here but certainly this initial tagging
34:34.800 approach is my first recommendation if
34:37.859 there's nothing in place
34:39.379 rather than the Big Bang approach of a
34:42.239 full end-to-end roadmap
34:46.320 and then also the trade-off scenarios
34:49.859 so I mentioned this earlier on to the
34:51.418 diagrams that we produced where maybe we
34:53.699 have Target States current states and
34:55.619 baselines from an architecture
34:58.200 perspective
34:59.339 um they're great of course because
35:00.599 Architects want to to build and model
35:02.760 things
35:04.440 um now arguably those are the the
35:06.359 details that are important for specific
35:08.640 teams
35:09.720 for stakeholders
35:11.520 displaying
35:13.200 argument diagrams BP men diagrams to
35:16.260 photograph content
35:17.760 is sometimes more useful for The
35:19.980 Architects
35:21.240 what you also want to keep in mind is
35:23.520 when you produce those views there is a
35:26.720 stakeholder outcome let's say
35:30.000 which is within one of those Target
35:31.980 States or if we have multiple Target
35:34.740 States there's the trade-off of what
35:37.380 we're actually trying to achieve
35:39.180 we're producing those States because we
35:41.339 want to potentially reduce cost
35:43.380 Now by reducing cost we might increase
35:45.359 our risk
35:47.160 if we're trying to be more efficient we
35:49.380 might reduce our complexity but then we
35:52.079 might also increase our costs
35:54.300 so that trade-off is also very important
35:57.540 um even more so for Tech debt of course
35:59.339 you can we can all reduce our Tech debt
36:01.680 quite quickly but I guarantee the costs
36:04.260 will Skyrocket and that won't be an
36:06.119 improved project so there is a trade
36:08.400 after being had coming back to that
36:09.720 balance we mentioned earlier on you want
36:11.820 to make sure that your your stakeholder
36:13.619 is actually aware of what you're trying
36:15.060 to do not from maybe an architectural
36:17.760 detail perspective but from a higher
36:20.040 level metric perspective and so having
36:22.500 multiple architectures having multiple
36:24.119 roadmaps helps you achieve those areas
36:26.640 as well
36:28.800 now communication is also key in this
36:31.079 case
36:33.180 and I've talked about raising awareness
36:34.800 and how I can actually do that but there
36:37.380 are four aspects that we find
36:39.660 um to how we actually communicate some
36:41.579 of the outputs from the architecture
36:42.900 team
36:43.740 so the first is awareness
36:45.780 we have to be aware of who we're
36:47.400 actually communicating to what role do
36:49.680 they play in the organization and that
36:52.079 will help dictate the context of the
36:54.420 views that we produce
36:56.400 then there's of course more of a story
36:58.560 that we have to tell we have to take our
37:00.480 users on a bit more of a journey in
37:02.280 terms of how we actually teach them the
37:04.260 content we've built and the story
37:06.359 obviously has to be compelling
37:08.160 you know especially I think in Tech debt
37:10.859 situation
37:12.540 um building a compelling story of why
37:14.760 technical debt should be reduced is half
37:17.640 the battle I think and that again is
37:20.400 coming back to context and awareness
37:22.380 who's the stakeholder they're likely
37:25.020 want to see some more metrics around
37:26.700 cost and risk and compliance rather than
37:29.760 the technical details around how that
37:31.680 started at the start
37:33.780 and then finally empathy
37:35.940 um obviously understanding what the
37:37.320 challenges are for those stakeholders
37:38.820 what their priorities are not everyone's
37:41.220 going to be interested in what we're
37:42.300 interested in so it has to be an
37:44.220 organization change let's say
37:47.280 um and the insights and deliverables
37:48.720 that we produce have to fall to the
37:50.460 right level as well
37:53.339 a key aspect and which you've seen
37:55.500 hopefully throughout all of these slides
37:56.820 so far and a lot of the examples is
37:59.339 around the visualization of the dates
38:01.079 that we have
38:02.280 I've mentioned Gantt charts and diagrams
38:05.280 and different graphical ways we can
38:06.960 display the content but really the
38:09.300 reason for that is to actually make
38:10.859 sense of the data and then to easily
38:13.619 then be able to communicate that
38:14.880 throughout the organization
38:17.640 a quick example of of why we actually
38:20.460 need that and I think it's important to
38:23.160 know why I think certainly sometimes we
38:25.740 think well you know a PowerPoint slide
38:28.020 is fine or an Excel sheet I can
38:29.700 understand so surely someone else can
38:31.140 understand it
38:32.700 um that's not always the case
38:34.740 um so certainly in certain situations
38:37.339 why we need data visualization becomes
38:40.020 really important
38:41.940 so in this example there's a whole bunch
38:44.820 of numbers in here and then typically uh
38:47.220 the question I would say was well how
38:48.720 many times does the Number Nine appear
38:52.200 now it's relatively difficult to do that
38:55.200 quickly but it is easy to do
38:59.040 now as Architects what we actually want
39:01.440 to do is make arguably the invisible
39:03.660 visible so what as Architects we need to
39:06.240 do from a data visualization perspective
39:07.980 is make that easier for our consumers
39:11.040 we can start highlighting these numbers
39:13.320 we can make it even more obvious by
39:15.720 highlighting them even further and
39:18.180 arguably the easiest approach is just to
39:20.280 have a count of how many times that
39:21.720 number appears
39:23.520 but this falls into more practical
39:25.500 examples as well
39:27.300 if you think of a table that just shows
39:29.220 the cost of services over the next five
39:31.320 years
39:32.220 I can see that certain Services increase
39:34.619 and decrease over the time
39:37.859 tables aren't the best way to represent
39:39.660 this information and we've provided
39:42.000 extensive webex's before purely on data
39:45.000 visualization masterclasses so I won't
39:46.740 spend too long on this topic
39:49.079 um but it's an important part to think
39:50.820 of
39:51.900 architecture teams May draw diagrams of
39:54.900 this
39:55.680 we can actually see our services as
39:57.720 components and have almost like a
39:59.160 traffic light system
40:00.660 but again it depends on the audience
40:02.220 because some users actually want to see
40:04.339 arguably better Trends within those
40:06.780 services
40:08.460 so if we actually build charts from
40:10.200 those we can be even more specific and
40:12.780 focus on one single service and see how
40:15.839 those costs are reducing over the years
40:17.660 that's a better approach than using the
40:20.400 table
40:21.599 it's a pretty rudimentary let's say
40:24.500 exercise or example
40:27.780 um but inevitably over the past 21 years
40:29.760 of us doing this we've seen
40:32.040 um how effective communication actually
40:33.660 works within organizations
40:35.940 there's arguably much better response
40:38.040 from all the stakeholders involved
40:40.079 having those visualizations
40:42.660 means that we can actually make
40:44.040 decisions much quicker and much better
40:47.099 decisions because we're working off more
40:49.339 real-time and consistent data
40:52.500 and also it gives us better control of
40:54.960 that situation
40:56.520 if we have multiple Excel spreadsheets
40:58.740 multiple Powerpoints and visual diagrams
400.900 and there isn't really maybe confidence
403.180 in the outputs we're delivering and that
405.579 really doesn't help the EA team in
407.320 general and therefore for the next
409.480 project there's less confidence again
411.820 so at the beginning for certain teams
413.859 we're building the confidence in the
416.320 team that's delivering these results it
418.420 does come from that effective
419.740 communication aspect
422.859 so how does that relate back to
424.300 Telegraph well typically even if we
426.520 focus on a single phase within Telegraph
428.320 in here
429.820 um aspects of this come back to the
431.619 initial Vision phase if you like but
433.240 really you want to actually start
435.099 establishing how we actually want to
436.720 build the work within an EA tool or
439.240 within your organization
441.099 so just actually taking talk up as a
443.619 framework as a as a good place to start
445.900 and identifying what you want to focus
448.000 on defining the scope for that so when
451.660 we talk about things like technical debt
453.880 reduction do we focus on specific
456.040 metrics how far in the future do we
458.859 actually want to model this and also
42:00.839 who's going to be involved and identify
42:03.060 which stakeholders we want to build the
42:04.920 content for and then the deliverables we
42:07.440 have to produce at the end as well
42:09.839 so that's just a single phase within
42:11.760 within the ADM but of course if you
42:13.740 incorporate all of those phases within
42:16.320 any type of project and it becomes even
42:18.420 more useful
42:21.119 one thing I would say is from a
42:23.760 dashboarding perspective and also just
42:25.680 from a pure toga perspective
42:28.859 um my experience of using it varies from
42:31.800 customers who are new to EA who want to
42:34.260 use toga and those who have been in the
42:36.839 EA game for for many years who already
42:39.420 have something like Telegraph as an
42:41.160 established framework within their
42:42.359 organization or established standard
42:45.720 and what I would focus on at the
42:48.960 beginning is taking a look through some
42:51.480 of the series guides that they have in
42:53.099 terms of how you can focus on specific
42:54.960 architectural domains
42:56.820 but also more importantly and I would
43:00.000 also treat toga as a bit more of a a
43:03.119 toolbox let's say and you've heard this
43:04.920 before I think as well but
43:06.900 that's a really important aspect of its
43:09.599 usefulness
43:11.160 use the parts that are necessary for the
43:13.740 projects that you're working on or for
43:15.420 the architectures that you're working on
43:17.579 if you sit down and say I want to
43:19.560 implement the entirety of telegraph
43:22.319 um that's not necessarily going to work
43:25.319 if you treat it as a bit more of a
43:26.940 toolbox if you search for terms within
43:28.859 togaf you'll find a few hits if you
43:31.500 search for technical debt for example or
43:33.660 if you search for agile architectures
43:35.480 that framework is supporting each of
43:38.160 those areas in their own right with just
43:41.520 enough architecture let's say
43:43.740 okay so treat aspects from Telegraph as
43:47.000 fundamentals to actually what you want
43:49.020 to build within your teams and this
43:51.420 example here you're seeing is really
43:52.920 just how it can then be used across a
43:55.020 wider audience
43:56.480 dashboards can't chats graph views these
43:59.819 are all aspects that tools can then
44:01.680 support with the addition of those
44:03.300 Frameworks
44:04.500 so Frameworks and standards have their
44:06.660 their practical uses within
44:08.460 organizations
44:10.200 um I'm biased for saying the tool will
44:11.819 also help deliver some of that work and
44:13.500 that's why we support things like
44:14.940 standards like togaf and many more of
44:17.460 the open group as well
44:19.560 um so certainly they provide a really
44:21.240 good accelerator but certainly obviously
44:23.579 from our perspective we think a talk and
44:25.319 even help even further to standardize
44:27.839 and provide a single source of Truth as
44:30.599 well
44:32.400 so hopefully from a from a talker
44:34.500 perspective maybe from a general EA
44:35.940 perspective that gives you some context
44:37.619 of of what we do some examples of how it
44:40.500 can be useful for Road mapping and
44:42.119 Technical debt
44:43.740 um if you have any specific
44:46.020 um queries on other types of work we've
44:48.420 done with the open group and how we've
44:50.160 actually used Abacus across other
44:52.200 Frameworks and notations
44:54.240 um feel free to reach out as well

00.000 would you like to learn about the
01.520 trade-offs we face in enterprise
03.600 architecture if so this video is for you
08.480 [Music]
16.000 hi my name is Mike Gibbs i'm the CEO of
18.400 GoCloud Careers and I'm an enterprise
20.080 architect with a little over 25 years
22.240 experience right now and I specialize in
24.880 PE helping people build enterprise
26.640 architecture careers cloud architecture
28.320 careers security architecture careers
30.640 but today we're going to talk about
32.719 enterprise architecture and balancing
35.120 tradeoffs so so the key to remember as
37.760 an enterprise architect or any architect
39.680 like a cloud architect or a security
41.280 architect is there's always going to be
44.000 conflicting factors when we have to make
46.320 a decision there will be always some
49.039 piece of technology that gives us this
50.800 advantage but causes us to have another
52.480 disadvantage or some process that causes
54.800 us to have some advantage and some other
56.960 disadvantage and as architects like
59.440 enterprise architects we have to help
001.199 make the decisions with the client to
003.520 help them pick the right tradeoffs to
005.600 make their business more successful so
008.000 we're going to be in a constant state of
010.320 evaluating what's right for the business
012.720 or what's wrong for the business and in
014.799 this video we're going to talk about the
015.000 No text
016.080 kinds of trade-offs that you'll actually
018.159 have and the way you think need to think
020.479 about evaluating these trade-offs so
022.560 let's talk about some basic trade-offs
024.320 for example and why we have them well a
026.799 trade-off is going to occur when we want
029.520 to improve or change something because
033.200 if we choose to enhance the security
035.280 architecture for example we may damage
037.759 the convenience of the system so as
040.960 architects we're going to constantly
043.439 look at competing requirements because
045.680 we're going to have some requirements
046.960 for example to minimize cost and then
048.560 other requirements that are to enhance
049.920 performance and increase security and at
052.240 the same time be scalable and agile and
055.520 th some of those are honestly
057.200 conflicting with each other so because
059.280 of this you know we're going to
02:00.719 obviously have a lot of stakeholder
02:02.000 engagement and the such to find out what
02:03.759 really matters but we're going to be
02:05.360 there looking at the strengths the
02:07.280 weaknesses the opportunities and threats
02:08.878 of every decision we make and every
02:11.280 technology choice and people and process
02:13.120 choice as well but in this video it's
02:14.480 about the technical trade-offs so
02:17.120 understand that our resources are going
02:18.640 to be limited uh so we have to be smart
02:22.000 with what we have and uh we have to
02:24.400 understand that if we improve one thing
02:26.239 it will impact something else so we're
02:27.760 have to kind of understand the entire
02:29.440 structure of everything going on so
02:31.680 let's talk about one of the most common
02:33.360 architectural trade-offs cost versus
02:36.239 performance
02:38.000 so if we reduce cost do we reduce
02:42.800 performance well sometimes no we can
02:46.400 have a workload in the cloud that's too
02:48.239 expensive in the cloud and move that
02:50.400 back to the data center and potentially
02:52.800 decrease our cost by 50% and keep the
02:55.360 same level of performance for that
02:57.760 workload now another workload may be
02:59.360 much cheaper in the cloud but you know
03:01.680 there's always that cost versus
03:03.120 performance but uh sometimes we don't
03:05.519 have to spend more to get that
03:06.800 performance we just have to change the
03:08.319 architecture of where it's located so
03:10.720 think about that now the next thing I
03:13.200 want you to think about is the about
03:14.720 flexibility versus standardization
03:17.840 so if we allow our teams and our or
03:20.720 people to be very flexible that might
03:23.599 work really well in environments that
03:25.920 need a lot of customization
03:28.959 and we might need flexibility in our
03:31.440 tools for example if we need a great
03:34.400 degree of customization
03:36.879 for example a physician may have have a
03:38.959 lot of professional judgment in their
03:40.000 No text
03:41.040 job and therefore need a system that's
03:43.200 adaptable to them a chef at a customized
03:46.480 restaurant may need systems that are a
03:48.239 little bit adaptable likewise a chain
03:50.640 restaurant like a McDonald may need
03:52.400 systems that are very inflexible to
03:55.040 support people doing a very precision
03:56.959 job following a precision process now
04:00.080 that level of a flexibility versus
04:02.159 standardization we have to think about
04:03.519 in everything do we use a standardized
04:06.400 tool that's going to work everywhere or
04:07.920 do we use a tool that's a little more
04:09.360 flexible but think flexibility versus
04:11.280 standardization is going to be a
04:13.680 constant tool the more we standardize
04:16.000 things generally speaking the greater
04:17.440 the simplicity and the elegance long
04:19.600 term but what about businesses that need
04:22.000 more flexibility and organizations that
04:24.560 need that as part of their role or their
04:26.560 process so we're always going to be
04:27.840 balancing that way as well another
04:30.560 massive trade-off in every enterprise
04:32.240 architecture is going to be security
04:33.680 versus user convenience the tighter our
04:36.800 security controls the better our
04:39.040 security is to a point and generally
04:41.840 speaking the better our compliance is to
04:44.720 a point especially if we can make that
04:47.520 security experience as frictionless as
04:49.680 possible but at some point if we put
04:52.639 massive security into the system it's
04:54.720 going to slow down productivity if we
04:57.440 have a a worker that take needs 10
04:59.360 security checks on the way into the
05:00.960 office it's going to slow them down each
05:03.040 day every time they need to leave and go
05:04.800 out of the office for example so we have
05:07.039 to think about that in the systems as
05:08.960 well that we use if we lock the systems
05:11.280 down with such tight security controls I
05:13.840 think it's going to be technical
05:14.800 controls that we're talking about or
05:16.080 other controls it will make it harder
05:18.240 for the users to do their work and they
05:20.160 will get less work done they'll probably
05:22.240 be less happy about it too but keep that
05:23.759 in the back of your mind now another
05:26.160 thing we have to think about in
05:27.360 enterprise architecture is innovation
05:29.199 versus stability
05:31.360 so we can adopt every cool new
05:33.759 technology and every new feature as fast
05:35.440 as we get it okay we could do that now
05:38.800 what happens with all these new
05:39.919 technologies and these new features well
05:42.080 if we're pushing the bleeding edge we're
05:43.680 probably going to have lots of bugs and
05:45.440 lots of instabilities so we have to
05:48.240 think about does that make sense for the
05:51.120 business now I have to tell you at one
05:53.600 point early in my career I worked for
05:55.440 the largest market maker on the NASDAQ
05:57.520 and their speed and agility and
06:00.479 basically what helped them was they had
06:02.080 an innovative trading system and it was
06:03.000 No text
06:03.759 faster than anybody else's system on the
06:05.440 world and each day they pushed new code
06:08.080 they tried to make it better and better
06:09.280 as often as they could now that was
06:12.400 innovation and it did work for this
06:14.560 business until it made a massive mistake
06:16.880 in technology which actually put them
06:18.560 out of business but that was a company
06:20.800 that was focused on innovation other
06:23.520 companies need stability if you're
06:25.360 running a hospital for example those
06:27.840 systems can't go down you can't innovate
06:30.800 quite as quickly if your systems need to
06:32.960 be there or an emergency call system
06:35.520 like a 911 in the US or a 999 in the UK
06:38.639 for example that can't go down they
06:40.639 can't innovate that fast they need to
06:42.160 test test retest they need lower risk
06:47.120 now the next thing we really want to
06:48.800 think about is like the centralization
06:50.400 versus decentralization that's a common
06:52.400 trade-off so whenever we centralize IT
06:55.680 resources in a central couple of data
06:57.680 centers for example or a data center
06:59.360 whatever we choose to uh it makes it
07:02.160 much easier to govern uh the security is
07:04.960 much more simple and elegant and we tend
07:07.199 to get an economy of scale by comparison
07:09.919 if we use decentralized resources and
07:12.400 we're in four data centers and six
07:14.800 clouds and a whole bunch of collocation
07:17.440 centers we're probably going to get the
07:19.759 best performance that we possibly could
07:22.080 but it's going to be a lot more complex
07:25.520 to manage
07:28.240 and uh we have to think about that how
07:30.000 are how are these systems going to be
07:31.360 managed
07:33.360 now let's think about scalability
07:35.919 versus complexity
07:39.039 well that's going to be another
07:41.199 trade-off because highly scalable
07:43.039 systems
07:45.039 require a lot of future readiness in
07:47.120 their design and certain parts of the
07:49.599 foundation often like the network
07:51.199 backbone for example is going to need a
07:54.080 lot more work upfront and planning if
07:57.599 you're planning on a lot of growth
07:59.000 No text
08:00.800 and when you're dealing with that you
08:02.639 actually have to design the scalability
08:04.319 ahead of time in certain places which
08:08.000 increases complexity not terribly but it
08:10.639 does increase complexity and it does
08:12.319 increase cost by comparison sometimes
08:15.199 we're looking for something that's
08:16.319 faster to deploy and easier to manage
08:18.639 and if we don't need giant scalability
08:21.120 then we don't necessarily have to put in
08:22.879 these giant enormous plans so it all
08:25.759 goes back to knowing what the business
08:26.960 is trying to do
08:29.599 and uh another trade-off that we often
08:31.520 make is whether we develop it inhouse or
08:33.760 whether we outsource it so whenever
08:36.559 things are developed inhouse they can be
08:39.279 customized for the need of the
08:40.640 organization you have complete control
08:43.519 over things for example complete control
08:46.640 over the security now that could be your
08:49.120 data center versus a public cloud for
08:51.040 example it could be your applications
08:53.040 versus an outsourced application but
08:54.959 when you do it yourself you have
08:57.279 ultimate control now if I have our own
09:00.720 private cloud and I have our own private
09:02.800 data center I can do all kinds of
09:04.560 traffic prioritization and security
09:06.160 things I could never do on the public
09:07.839 cloud
09:09.360 and uh but you know now I need to build
09:11.680 it i need the facilities i need the real
09:14.240 estate i need the people who maintain it
09:17.040 and you know the power there's a lot
09:18.560 that goes into it of course if we
09:20.720 outsource we can focus on our business
09:22.880 not our technology
09:24.640 which is kind of nice and sometimes if
09:27.360 we outsource it gets cheaper sometimes
09:29.360 not always uh but it typically it's
09:31.680 easier for the business to focus on
09:33.200 their core business the only question we
09:36.000 have to think about is how important is
09:38.480 technology to that business in the first
09:40.000 place and if technology is critical to
09:42.080 that business maybe technology needs to
09:43.760 be one of their core competencies but
09:45.360 these are things to think about these
09:46.640 are all trade-offs that's why there's
09:47.839 really no right or wrong answer
09:50.640 now compliance versus agility that's
09:54.240 another thing if we have to adhere to
09:57.519 certain regulatory frameworks
10:00.880 that may change some of the agility we
10:02.880 have in our systems and we have to
10:05.279 accept that if it's required for our job
10:07.760 so we have to plan these things and know
10:09.360 ahead of time
10:11.680 and you know the last one is uh going to
10:14.959 be the this this I'll call it the simple
10:18.000 and elegant versus uh the highly
10:21.360 customized
10:23.680 simple and elegant things tend to be
10:25.600 very easy to maintain they require less
10:29.200 staff and less capable staff so they
10:31.360 really reduce long-term overhead
10:34.959 and uh they typically reduce downtime
10:36.959 and outages because things are very
10:38.800 simple so sometimes simple and elegant
10:41.279 and when we can get away with simple and
10:42.959 elegant uh the AAMS Razer approach the
10:45.200 simplest solution is usually the best
10:47.040 lots of times it is but what about a
10:49.600 business that has greater needs that
10:51.600 requires a greater degree of
10:53.200 customization well there's we go there
10:55.760 we're going back to the customization
10:57.440 and the complexity so see these are all
100.240 trade-offs we have in cloud architecture
102.240 or enterprise architecture or security
104.720 architecture and that's why we have to
106.959 make these trade-offs because everything
108.720 we do uh gives us some benefit and
111.120 another and another loss or a detractor
113.680 and we have to balance those benefits to
115.920 figure out what's best for the business

# TOGAF (What is TOGAF and the TOGAF Architecture Development Method)
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/qOXEW7B3DwI

00.983 Are you looking to learn about TOGAF
03.050 If so, this video is for you.
09.683 In this video we will cover what is TOGAF
12.316 The purpose of the TOGAF frameworkand the phases of the TOGAF framework.
16.700 And if you'd like more detailsof each phase of the TOGAF framework,
20.600 we've got a playlist for youin the description of this video.
25.016 Now let's begin with what is TOGAF
28.166 TOGAF is a framework to help organizationsoptimize their business performance.
33.683 So what does that mean?
35.216 Let me first explain the three maincomponents of a successful business.
39.383 They are people, processes,and of course, our favorite technology,
45.016 the people arethose that work for the company
47.550 as well as those that buythe organizations projects.
51.616 The processes are how things get done.
54.300 For example, how does a companysell its product or service
57.416 and how these products and servicesare delivered?
000.616 The technology are the systems thatsupport the company in its operations.
005.083 Things like servers, data,applications and networks.
009.200 The key to remember iswe can't just throw technology
012.900 at a problem and expect the technologyto help the organization.
018.016 If we don't
018.750 consider the organizations,people, processes and technology,
022.766 there is a significant chance that the newdesign will actually hurt the business.
027.950 In fact,if we look at most new architectures,
030.383 they are complete disasters.
032.416 Here are some statistics.
034.466 McKinsey reportsthat only 30% of all digital
037.883 transformation projects are successful,meaning 70% fell.
041.966 In a recent article in CIO magazine shows
044.600 that half of cloudtransformations are abject failures.
048.116 This is where TOGAF comes to the rescue.
050.866 TOGAF is about designing systemsto support the business and its goals.
056.066 TOGAF focuses on everythingthat's needed to be successful,
059.783 meaning the people,the processes and the technology
02:03.716 and this enables organizationsto make sure that the architectures
02:07.100 they choose will actually optimizetheir business performance,
02:10.515 as opposed to just adding costand complexity to the business.
02:15.533 TOGAF does this by creating a process
02:18.500 for architects to design architecturesthat focus on the key issues.
02:23.250 TOGAF preventspeople from applying technology
02:25.816 without firstconsidering how impact the business.
02:29.566 So how does the TOGAF work?
02:31.500 It suggests phases for all parts of thearchitectural design and development.
02:35.933 Let's discuss the phases of the togaarchitecture developed mathematically.
02:40.433 Also called the TOGAF ADM
02:44.516 The first main phaseis the architecture of vision.
02:48.316 This phase is about finding the visionfor the client's business.
02:52.700 Now, this is going to be criticalto make sure the technology solution
02:55.916 will ultimately support the businessesgoals.
02:59.000 The next phase is about the businessarchitecture.
03:02.416 TOGAF willthen help you evaluate how the business
03:05.450 operates today, which is calledthe current business architecture.
03:08.633 And this is where we plan how the businessdesires to operate in the future, often
03:12.916 called the future business architectureor the target business architecture.
03:17.266 Now the next phase is aboutthe information systems architecture.
03:22.433 Now here, what we need to do,we need to baseline
03:25.550 how do organizations use its dataand the applications
03:29.100 which they have and their current dataarchitecture and application architecture.
03:33.350 And then we have to figure outhow the organization wants to use data
03:37.050 and applications in the future,which of course will be the future.
03:40.516 Future data architecture and applicationarchitecture.
03:44.300 Now, the next phase is to evaluateall the rest of the technology.
03:48.683 This isabout evaluating the current technology
03:50.866 systems, otherwise knownas the current technology architecture,
03:54.866 and then determiningthe technology changes that are needed
03:58.050 to support the new business architecturebased upon the corporate vision.
04:01.883 This is going to be the future technologyarchitecture
04:04.766 now after we've designedthis main architecture.
04:07.650 Now we need to start lookingfor opportunities and solutions.
04:11.566 This is really about findingthe technology that's needed,
04:14.216 which is often calledan architectural building blocks.
04:17.716 Now this phase is about creatingthe detailed
04:21.000 architecture of blocks,meaning what are we going to use?
04:24.866 So maybe we have a technologylike a virtual machine
04:28.100 or a storage area network or a firewall.
04:31.616 Now the next phase is about creatingwhat we call solution building blocks.
04:36.866 This is where we take the technologythat we choose, say, a virtual machine,
04:41.416 and we place it with the manufacturerspecific term.
04:44.783 So of a virtual machine
04:45.983 hosted on NWC will call it an easyto instance, for example.
04:50.250 Now the next phase of TOGAFis about migration planning.
04:53.416 This is about planning the migration.
04:55.950 For example, the timelines,the number of people needed
04:59.483 and the types of people necessaryto build the architecture.
05:03.466 Now the next phase will be aboutimplementation governance.
05:06.866 This is about finding the peoplewho are involved in decision
05:10.066 making and hold accountabilityand can control the implementation.
05:15.083 The last phase in the TOGAFframework is about change management.
05:18.950 This phase is going to be howchanges are made and performing an impact
05:23.216 assessment on how any changes will affectthe business as well as its systems.
05:28.550 I hope you've enjoyed this video onwhat is TOGAF,
05:31.366 the purpose of the TOGAF frameworkand the phases of the TOGAF framework.

00.120 our data is a complete mess we have five different definitions of customer across
06.640 departments this was what the CIO of a Fortune 500 company told me right before
12.400 they spent 2 million on a failed data integration project if you're dealing
17.520 with data silos inconsistent reporting or struggling to extract value from your
22.960 organization's data you're in the right place I'll show you how to build a
28.240 coherent Enterprise data architect Ure using the Edie Model A framework used by
33.320 the world's most datadriven companies have you ever wondered why so many organizations struggle to make sense of
39.800 their data despite investing millions in technology companies hire teams of data
46.600 scientists by expensive analytics platforms and migrate everything to the
53.079 Cloud yet still find themselves drowning in data while starving for
58.719 insights the problem isn't a lack of data or even insufficient technology it's something more fundamental think
004.640 about it like this would you start building a house without a blueprint of course not yet organizations routinely
011.479 try to build their Data Systems without a proper Enterprise data architecture they collect data haphazardly create
018.880 isolated databases for specific projects and then wonder why departments can't
023.960 share information effectively or why their analytics initiatives keep hitting
029.320 roadblocks box Enterprise data architecture or Eda serves as the
035.479 comprehensive blueprint that organizes how data flows through your organization
040.920 it Maps out how data is collected stored transformed distributed and ultimately
046.759 used to create value but it goes beyond simple technical diagrams a true Eda captures
048.000 No text
054.479 the inter relationships between data processes applications and perhaps most
02:00.280 importantly people let me be clear about what Eda is not it's not the same as database design which focuses narrowly
02:08.080 on how information is structured within a specific system it's also not system
02:15.200 architecture which primarily concerns the technical infrastructure instead Eda
02:20.760 takes a holistic view of the entire data life cycle from creation to consumption
02:26.920 crossing departmental boundaries and Technology platform forms the difference becomes obvious when you consider what
02:33.160 happens in organizations without proper architecture marketing collects customer data in one format sales in another and
02:41.480 customer service in yet a third product names differ across systems customer
02:47.560 identifiers don't match and data definitions contradict each other the
02:52.760 result reports that should show the same information display wildly different numbers leading Executives to lose trust
02:59.120 in the data entirely what makes Eda particularly powerful is that it's fundamentally a strategic business asset
03:05.560 not merely a technical implementation when done right it aligns directly with business objectives and
03:13.319 capabilities it answers questions like what data do we need to support our
03:18.720 business strategy how should information flow between departments what governance policies
03:25.280 ensure our data remains accurate and secure which metric matter most for
03:30.760 measuring success to develop an effective Enterprise data architecture
03:35.959 many organizations have adopted the ad model analysis design development
03:42.879 implementation and evaluation originally developed for instructional Design This framework has
03:50.040 proven remarkably effective for data architecture because it ensures a
03:55.560 methodical approach that starts with understanding the business context before jumping to Technical Solutions
04:01.760 the power of a well-implemented Eda becomes clear when you look at real world examples consider the environment
04:10.120 agency of England which faced significant challenges with inconsistent
04:15.519 data across departments their implementation of proper data architecture began with
04:21.959 something surprisingly simple but powerful aligning their scientific terminology and data models this
04:29.080 standardization transformed their ability to manage environmental data and produce accurate
04:35.240 reports ultimately leading to better Environmental Protection decisions or
04:40.400 take the example of kuid a large construction company that struggled with project management by implementing
04:46.600 Enterprise data architecture principles they created standardized data models that clarified their business processes
04:53.720 and improved communication across departments the result was better resource allocation reduced delays and
05:00.560 ultimately improved project outcomes their architecture didn't just organize
05:05.759 data it provided a common language that helped bridge the gap between business
05:10.919 units these success stories highlight the stark contrast between organizations
05:16.479 that get Eda right and those that get it wrong the business impact can be measured in millions of dollars
05:24.160 companies with effective data architecture typically experience faster time to market for new product products
05:30.520 more accurate business forecasting reduced operational costs and better
05:35.639 Regulatory Compliance meanwhile companies without proper architecture often suffer from
05:42.560 duplicated efforts data quality issues security vulnerabilities and an
05:47.840 inability to adapt quickly to Market changes here's what might surprise you
05:53.400 the difference between success and failure in Enterprise data architecture rarely comes down to technical expertise
06:01.120 of course technical knowledge matters but the organizations that truly
06:06.880 transform their data capabilities are the ones that start by deeply
06:12.680 understanding their business needs processes and objectives in simple terms Enterprise data architecture isn't about
06:20.360 creating complicated diagrams that no one understands or implementing the trendiest database technology it's about
06:27.800 creating a clear practice iCal blueprint that shows how data supports your
06:33.400 specific business it's about ensuring everyone in the organization uses consistent terms and follows consistent
06:40.880 processes and ultimately it's about making sure the right information reaches the right people at the right
06:47.039 time so they can make better decisions this is why the first step in the add model analysis is so
06:50.000 No text
06:54.440 crucial before you can design an effective architecture you need to thoroughly understand your current uh
07:01.240 data landscape business requirements and pain points you need to identify what's
07:07.440 working what's broken and what opportunities exist to transform how your organization uses data While most
07:15.960 Executives can name their top competitors or key product lines without
07:21.759 hesitation ask them to identify all their critical data sources and watch
07:28.039 the confidence disappear the gap between what organizations think
07:33.360 they know about their data and what they actually know represents one of the greatest hidden risks in business today
07:41.720 this thorough understanding begins with a startling reality organizations that skip proper data analysis often find
07:50.159 themselves building architectures that solve the wrong problems or Miss critical requirements
07:56.159 entirely the analysis phase of the add model isn't just a preliminary step it's
08:01.400 the foundation upon which everything else stands it's like an archaeologist
08:07.199 carefully mapping a site before excavation begins without this crucial groundwork you risk damaging valuable
08:15.080 artifacts or missing Hidden Treasures entirely similarly without proper
08:20.800 analysis of your data environment you risk Building Solutions that don't address your actual business problems
08:26.919 why do organizations Rush past this critical phase the pressure to deliver
08:32.159 quick results often pushes teams to jump straight into designing and implementing Solutions based on assumptions rather
08:39.240 than evidence Executives want to see tangible progress and Analysis work can seem
08:45.600 invisible compared to new dashboard rollouts or database
08:51.040 migrations this pressure creates a dangerous shortcut mentality we know
08:57.360 what our problems are let's just fix them that ultimately leads to costly
09:02.480 rework when those assumptions prove incorrect A systematic approach to data
09:09.200 inventory forms the Cornerstone of effective analysis this isn't simply
09:14.240 listing databases and applications it requires documenting existing data
09:19.600 sources their formats ownership structures and quality assessments think
09:26.160 of it as creating a comprehensive map of your data territory before planning any
09:32.120 Journeys across it um this inventory process reveals surprising insights in
09:37.560 nearly every organization you'll discover Shadow it systems storing critical business information Excel
09:45.079 spread sheets functioning as unofficial databases and forgotten data
09:50.480 repositories containing valuable historical information more importantly
09:55.519 you'll identify overlapping systems with conflicting information like when marketing finance and
10:02.000 operations all track customer satisfaction using completely different methodologies and metrics templates can
10:10.200 streamline this inventory process ensuring you capture consistent information across all sources a
10:17.560 well-designed template includes fields for data source name business owner

16:21.720 Frameworks but here's the Paradox many organizations
16:27.040 face choosing between Frameworks like zakman toaf and damad
16:34.040 demok often feels like selecting tools for a job you don't fully understand
16:40.079 until you've completed it this challenge explains why nearly 80% of failed data
16:47.480 initiatives stumble not because of Technology limitations but because they
16:52.920 selected Frameworks ill suited to their organizational structure think of architecture Frameworks specialized
16:59.560 blueprints for complex data environments just as Architects use different
17:04.720 blueprint Styles depending on whether they're designing a hospital a school or a residence data Architects need
17:11.559 Frameworks tailored to specific organizational needs the right framework provides structure without stifling
17:18.959 Innovation the wrong one creates unnecessary complexity that can derail your entire initiative the zakman
17:26.240 framework stands out with its uniqu comprehensive Matrix approach imagine a
17:32.799 6x6 grid where the columns represent fundamental questions what how where who
17:39.480 when why while the rows represent different perspectives planner owner
17:45.799 designer Builder subcontractor and Enterprise operation this elegant structure creates
17:52.440 36 intersections each addressing a specific aspect of your architecture for
17:58.840 for example the intersection of what and owner focuses on the business entities
18:04.120 important to leadership while how and Builder addresses the specific
18:09.760 technology functions developers need to implement this matrix-based approach
18:15.000 makes zakman particularly valuable for organizations U needing to understand
18:20.880 complex interrelationships between business and Technical domains the framework essentially
18:27.559 creates a common language between executive leadership and uh technical
18:33.159 implementers ensuring that business priorities remain Central throughout the architectural process toaf takes a
18:40.559 distinctly different approach through its architecture development method
18:46.159 ADM rather than providing a static Matrix toaf offers a dynamic cycle of
18:51.760 development phases this iterative approach starts with a preliminary phase to establish
18:58.120 capabilities moves through requirement management Vision development and architecture
19:03.400 creation across business Information Systems and Technology domains before
19:09.000 addressing migration planning implementation and change management what makes TOA particularly powerful is
19:16.200 its Relentless focus on business alignment each phase of the ADM connects
19:21.480 back to business requirements creating a continuous feedback loop that enables
19:26.880 the architecture to evolve as business needs change for organizations
19:32.080 undergoing digital transformation or facing rapidly shifting market conditions this adaptability proves
19:38.600 invaluable the framework essentially transforms architecture from a one-time project into an ongoing capability that
19:46.000 supports business agility damad dambuk takes a more specialized approach by
19:51.159 focusing specifically on data management practices while zachman and toaf address
19:57.600 the broader ENT entprise architecture landscape damama DMB concentrates on establishing
20:04.919 rigorous data management practices the framework covers everything from data governance and quality management to
20:12.080 security integration and metadata management this data Centric approach
20:17.640 makes dhama demok an excellent complement to broader Frameworks many
20:24.080 organizations successfully implement it alongside either zachman or to G using
20:29.880 dhamma dmbok to strengthen their data management capabilities while the other
20:35.320 framework provides the broader architectural context this combination can be
20:41.120 particularly effective for organizations where data quality and governance represent significant challenges
20:48.080 selecting the right framework requires careful consideration of your organization's specific context Size
20:55.880 Matters larger Enterprises with complex Le Lex Legacy systems often benefit from
201.919 toa's comprehensive methodology while smaller organizations
207.280 may find zman's Clarity more accessible industry considerations also
213.960 play a role with highly regulated sectors like health care or financial
219.000 services requiring the rigorous governance approaches of dhad
224.120 dmbok existing organizational practices should influence your decision as as well if your organization already
230.960 Embraces agile methodologies toa's iterative approach will likely integrate
238.400 more smoothly than Zak man's more structured Matrix conversely if your organization
244.720 struggles with communication between business and Technical teams zman's clear categorization system May provide
251.279 exactly the shared vocabulary you need your specific goals should ultimately Drive framework selection are you
258.039 primarily focused on improving data quality and governance demad dmbok
22:03.679 offers specialized guidance in these areas need to align disparate business
22:09.679 units around a common architecture Vision toa's business architecture
22:15.640 emphasis provides valuable tools struggling to establish clear relationships between business
22:21.520 priorities and Technical implementations Zak man's Matrix approach excels at making these
22:27.279 connections explicit many organizations find that a hybrid approach works best for their specific
22:33.400 needs for example a Health Care Organization might adopt toa's overall
22:39.360 methodology while incorporating dhma dambo specialized guidance on data
22:45.120 privacy and compliance a Manufacturing Company might use Zak man's Matrix to
22:51.480 establish clear understanding of relationships between business and Technical domains then Implement
22:57.520 specific data govern governance practices from damad demok to address quality issues in production data these
23:04.279 hybrid approaches aren't without challenges ensuring consistency across
23:10.200 Frameworks requires careful integration planning different Frameworks often use
23:16.960 varying terminology and conceptual models that must be
23:22.080 reconciled governance can become particularly complex when different parts of the organization follow
23:28.200 different Frameworks despite these challenges the benefits of tailoring Frameworks to specific organizational
23:34.919 needs often outweigh the integration complexity a Regional Bank demonstrates
23:40.640 this hybrid approach effectively they began with toaf to establish their overall architectural process but
23:48.320 quickly realized that their data governance challenges required specialized attention by incorporating
23:55.600 elements of dhama damoka particular L around data quality management and stewardship they created a custom
24:03.600 framework that addressed their unique needs the results were impressive
24:10.520 Regulatory Compliance issues decreased by 64% while data quality scores improved
24:17.840 across all major systems similarly um manufacturing firm found that neither framework alone
24:24.919 addressed their specific challenges they adopted zakman Matrix approach to create
24:30.159 Clarity around roles and responsibilities particularly valuable in their Matrix organization structure
24:37.000 however they Incorporated toa's implementation planning methodologies to
24:42.159 create practical road maps for architecture projects this hybrid
24:47.799 approach helped them break down long-standing silos between operational technology and information technology
24:54.640 teams enabling their digital transformation initiatives to move forward after years of stalled progress
25:01.399 the key lesson from these examples is clear Frameworks should be adapted to fit your organization not vice versa too
25:09.320 many organizations make the mistake of trying to conform their practices to framework requirements creating
25:15.279 unnecessary friction and resistance successful implementations treat Frameworks as toolkits rather than rigid
25:22.720 methodologies selecting and adapting the elements that address specific organizational challenges after
25:26.000 No text
25:28.760 selecting the right framework organizations face an equally critical challenge creating data models that
25:36.000 bridge the technical business divide what if the greatest threat to your data initiatives isn't technology limitations
25:43.080 but simply the inability to create models that everyone involved can meaningfully comprehend data models are
25:50.200 where abstract architectural principles become tangible and usable they're the
25:55.240 bridge between your framework's theoretical guidance and the actual systems you'll build but here's where
26:01.440 many organizations stumble they Rush straight to creating detailed technical models without first establishing a
26:08.120 shared understanding of what the data actually means to the business at its core effective data modeling follows a
26:14.880 three- tiered approach that progressively adds detail while maintaining alignment with business
26:20.840 needs let's break down these three essential levels that form part of the design phase in our Addie framework the
26:28.279 conceptual data model serves as your highlevel business view think of it as the executive summary of your data
26:34.840 landscape what's particularly powerful about an effective conceptual model is
26:41.159 that it should ideally fit on a single page uh summarizing Only The Core
26:47.760 Business Concepts without overwhelming detail the single page approach isn't just about Simplicity it's a powerful
26:54.840 communication tool that forces Clarity and focus on what truly matters to the
27:00.559 business a financial services company I worked with struggled for months with a data Lake implementation because their
27:07.320 technical team kept building detailed models that Executives couldn't understand when they finally stepped
27:14.200 back and created a one-page conceptual model showing just the primary entities
27:19.240 customers accounts transactions products and their relationships suddenly the conversations changed business
27:26.279 stakeholders could point to specific entities and clearly articulate
27:32.200 their requirements and expectations the conceptual model answers fundamental business questions
27:38.799 what are our most important data entities how do they relate to each other these models deliberately avoid
27:46.240 technical details like data types primary keys or normalization rules
27:52.960 instead they focus on the business Concepts and their relationships in
27:58.200 language that resonates with non-technical stakeholders once you've established this shared understanding
28:03.799 you can move to The Logical data model this second tier adds more
28:10.159 granularity by defining the attributes of each entity and the specific
28:15.320 relationships between them The Logical model introduces more structure and
28:20.960 detail while remaining completely technology independent this Independence is crucial it ensures your model ref
28:28.120 reflects actual business needs rather than being constrained by specific
28:33.360 database limitations or technology choices for example your customer entity in the conceptual model might expand in
28:40.799 The Logical model to include attributes like customer ID name contact
28:46.200 information and demographic details the relationships between entities become
28:51.519 more precise specifying cardinality one to many many to many and setting the
28:57.760 state for eventual implementation The Logical model serves as the bridge between business Concepts
29:04.840 and Technical implementation adding the detail technical teams need while remaining accessible to business
29:11.720 stakeholders when done well it becomes an invaluable tool for validating requirements and ensuring alignment
29:17.960 before significant technical work begins only after these first two models are
29:23.000 established and validated should you move to the physical data model this
29:28.120 final tier translates your logical model into a specific technology
29:33.760 implementation here you'll incorporate database specific elements like table
29:38.880 structures indexes partitioning strategies and performance
29:43.919 optimizations the physical model accounts for the particular capabilities and limitations of your chosen database
29:51.159 platforms whether traditional relational databases nosql systems or cloud-based
29:57.640 data warehouses while creating these models might seem straightforward the
30:02.960 reality is that many organizations struggle with making them truly effective the key challenge often lies
30:09.080 in visualization how do you represent complex data relationships in ways that
30:14.640 non-technical stakeholders can actually understand effective data model
30:17.000 No text
30:21.120 visualizations balance completeness with Clarity they include definition
30:28.760 alongside entities and relationships making it easier for anyone to grasp what each element
30:36.200 represents color coding can distinguish different types of entities or data
30:42.240 domains interactive tools allow stakeholders to explore relationships at their own pace zooming in on areas of
30:49.720 Interest while maintaining context a healthcare organization I consulted with
30:55.159 used a technique where they created multip views of the same underlying model their clinical teams worked with
303.799 visualizations focused on patient care workflows while administrative teams
311.120 used views that highlighted billing and operational aspects this approach helped
319.000 each group engage with the model from their perspective while ensuring everyone worked from the same underlying
325.840 data architecture the the power of these models extends far beyond
332.000 documentation when created effectively they become communication tools that
337.120 bridge The Divide between business and it teams they provide a shared vocabulary and reference point that
344.159 helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures everyone is working toward the same goals consider a manufacturing
351.360 company that was implementing a new supply chain system their initial project meetings were filled with
357.080 confusion as business teams described requirements using terminology that
32:02.720 meant something completely different to the IT team by collaboratively building
32:08.279 data models that included clear definitions and examples they established a Common Language this
32:14.320 seemingly simple step reduced rework by over 40% and accelerated their
32:19.720 implementation timeline by nearly 2 months what makes data modeling truly
32:25.840 effective is embracing its it ative nature the model should evolve continuously as your understanding of
32:33.279 the business deepens and requirements change this isn't a sign of failure but
32:39.000 rather a healthy response to learning and adaptation organizations that treat data
32:45.200 models as living documents rather than static deliverables are better positioned to maintain alignment between
32:52.519 Technical implementations and business needs over time to facilitate this
32:57.960 iterative approach many organizations are shifting from traditional modeling tools to collaborative platforms that
33:06.320 support realtime feedback and versioning these tools allow business stakeholders
33:13.159 to comment directly on model elements suggest changes and see how the model
33:18.840 evolves over time when it comes to notation and representation common approaches like uml unified modeling
33:25.799 language and ER enti relationship diagrams provide standardized ways to
33:32.320 visually represent data relationships and structures these notations have become
33:38.399 industry standards because they make models accessible to a wider audience while providing sufficient detail for
33:44.360 technical implementation a telecommunications company found that uh adopting standard notations dramatically
33:51.919 improved cross functional collaboration previously different teams created models using their preferred formats
33:59.559 making it difficult to share understanding across departments by standardizing on ER
34:06.240 diagrams for conceptual models and uml for logical and physical models they
34:12.879 created a common visual language that anyone in the organization could learn to understand what's particularly
34:18.520 interesting about effective data modeling is how it often reveals insights that weren't apparent in
34:24.560 initial discussions when stakeholders see see their domain represented visually they

35:15.240 most elegant data models and Technical architectures will rapidly deteriorate
35:22.280 without proper governance Frameworks that balance protection with usability
35:27.920 here's the uncomfortable truth up to 70% of data governance initiatives fail
35:33.440 despite executive sponsorship and significant financial investment you might wonder why something seemingly
35:39.920 straightforward establishing rules for how data is managed encounters such high
35:46.320 failure rates the answer lies in a fundamental disconnect between
35:51.359 governance Theory and human reality organizations often approach
35:56.400 governance as a control mechanism rather than an enablement strategy creating
36:02.599 systems that look impressive on paper but crumble in practice data governance
36:09.280 isn't just another it initiative it's a business discipline that requires
36:14.480 careful integration with existing workflows and cultural norms at its core
36:20.760 effective governance establishes a framework where data can be trusted and
36:26.040 accessed by those who need it when they need it without creating bureaucratic
36:31.079 bottlenecks that frustrate everyday users the foundational challenge lies in
36:36.240 Striking the right balance too little governance leads to chaos inconsistent definitions unknown data quality and
36:44.200 Regulatory exposure too much governance creates paralyzing bureaucracy where
36:49.480 legitimate data needs go unmet because accessing information becomes too cumbersome finding this equilibrium
36:57.000 requires understanding both technical requirements and human
37:03.720 psychology let's examine the four pillars that constitute effective governance starting with roles and
37:12.119 responsibilities many governance failures stem from ambiguity about who
37:18.200 can make decisions about data a comprehensive roles and responsibilities
37:24.160 Matrix eliminates this confusion by clear clearly defining who serves as
37:30.079 data owners stewards custodians and consumers data owners typically reside
37:36.760 in business units and hold ultimate accountability for accuracy and proper
37:42.240 usage within their domain they Define requirements but delegate day-to-day
37:47.960 responsibilities to data stewards who monitor quality resolve issues and
37:53.680 ensure compliance with standards meanwhile data custodians often it
37:59.040 professionals manage the technical environment while consumers represent end users who need data for business
38:06.880 purposes consider how a healthc Care Organization transformed their medication error reporting by
38:13.720 implementing this Matrix approach previously when errors appeared
38:19.640 in reports nobody took ownership of resolving discrepancies between Pharmacy
38:25.119 and nursing data by designating the chief medical officer as data owner
38:31.720 appointing departmental stewards and clarifying its's custodial role they
38:37.040 reduced reporting inconsistencies by 58% within 6 months the second pillar
38:43.720 involves establishing clear policies and standards that Define expectations for
38:49.520 data management effective policies address fundamental questions what
38:55.359 constitutes highquality data how should sensitive information be
39:00.720 protected who can access which data and under what
39:06.560 circumstances what processes must be followed when creating or modifying data rather than creating exhaustive
39:13.040 documentation that nobody reads successful organizations focus on developing practical standards that
39:20.200 directly address business risks and opportunities each standard should
39:25.280 include specific metrics that make compliance measurable rather than
39:31.000 subjective for instance instead of vaguely requiring accurate customer
39:36.200 information specify that phone numbers must follow the e164 standard with 95%

40:10.000 theoretical constructs with minimal practical impact a global manufacturer discovered
40:16.800 this reality when their new data quality policy initially failed to improve
40:22.520 production forecasting accuracy the Breakthrough came when they implemented
40:28.119 a simple process requiring quarterly data quality assessments tied to
40:33.280 performance reviews department heads suddenly had personal incentives to ensure their teams followed data
40:40.160 standards dramatically improving forecast accuracy the final pillar
40:44.000 No text
40:45.440 consists of the tools that support governance activities while technology alone cannot solve governance challenges
40:52.760 appropriate tools significantly reduce the friction associated with compliance modern data cataloges quality monitoring
400.119 platforms and metadata Management Systems provide visibility into Data assets and automate governance tasks
407.560 that would otherwise create unsustainable manual

444.720 that assign clear accountability the most effective approach distributes
449.960 responsibility throughout the organization rather than concentrating it within it or a central governance
456.960 team domain-based ownership models assign accountability to business units that
42:03.480 derive value from specific data domains for example marketing becomes
42:08.839 responsible for customer demographic data while Finance owns financial performance metrics this alignment

42:50.079 can be automatically validated wherever possible a telecommunications company
42:55.640 significantly improved their customer data by establishing specific completeness thresholds for different
43:01.880 customer segments premium business accounts required 95% completeness across 20 key

546.400 what makes Ai and machine learning architecturally different while traditional systems
553.680 typically work with well structured data following predictable patterns AI
559.280 thrives on massive volumes of diverse data types flowing at unprecedented
52:06.160 speeds it's not just about having more data it's about having architectures
52:11.960 specifically designed to handle the unique requirements of machine learning workloads the first critical
52:18.040 consideration is volume machine learning models particularly deep Learning Systems require enormous training data

0052.839 demonstrates the tangible value of your architecture Investments what makes evaluating
0059.599 architecture Effectiveness particularly challenging is that many of its benefits manifest indirectly and overextended
002:06.559 periods when a company invests millions in revamping their data architecture the
002:12.520 executive team understandably wants clear evidence of return on investment but the relationship between
002:18.400 architectural changes and business outcomes isn't always straightforward or immediate for instance a improvements in

0123.880 business priorities rather than technical ideals they measure what matters to the organization not just
0130.760 what's easy to measure they balance comprehensive assessment with practical limitations on time and resources and
0138.239 most importantly they treat evaluation not as a final judgment but as the starting point for continuous
0143.639 Improvement traditional data architectures that took years to perfect can become obsolete almost overnight
0150.520 when confronted with the reality of managed services and serverless Computing the Cloud doesn't just invite
0156.760 architectural change it demands it what many organizations discover
012:03.400 during Cloud migration is that their carefully crafted architectures suddenly
012:09.080 feel as outdated as floppy discs in a world of solid state drives this
012:14.880 transformation forces Architects to confront a crucial question how do you maintain your core principles when the
012:21.080 implementation landscape has fundamentally changed architecture isn't meant to be static it's a living
012:27.239 framework that must evolve with changing business needs technological innovations
012:32.760 and market conditions think of it as an organism that adapts to its environment
012:38.360 rather than a monument set in stone this Evolution becomes particularly critical
012:43.760 when organizations transition to Cloud environments where the very nature of computing resources shifts dramatically
012:51.800 Cloud platforms fundamentally transform traditional architectural approaches by
012:57.159 introducing managed services and serverless Computing options these Innovations eliminate much of the
013:04.400 infrastructure management burden that previously consumed it resources instead of provisioning
013:11.679 servers managing databases and handling scaling manually organizations can
013:18.040 leverage Cloud native services that handle these functions automatically
013:23.560 this shift allows data teams to focus more on creating business value and less
013:30.600 on maintaining infrastructure consider what happens when an organization moves from on
013:36.199 premises data warehouses to cloud-based
013:41.600 Alternatives suddenly Concepts like capacity planning take on different
013:47.880 meanings instead of purchasing Hardware to accommodate Peak loads plus a safety
013:54.239 margin Architects can design for elasticity where resources scale up and down
014:01.800 automatically based on actual demand this fundamental shift requires
014:07.600 rethinking how we approach resource allocation performance optimization and
014:12.760 cost management the transition isn't without challenges organizations
014:18.239 adopting Cloud architectures often struggle to maintain architectural
014:23.719 Integrity while ad adapting to new technologies data governance becomes
014:29.120 more complex when information flows between on premises systems and multiple
014:35.320 Cloud environments integration challenges multiply when different departments
014:41.719 adopt cloud services independently potentially creating new
014:47.080 data silos in the cloud rather than solving existing ones security models
014:53.600 also require significant adaptation the shared responsibility
014:59.880 model of cloud computing means organizations must recalibrate their security controls understanding which
015:06.320 aspects are handled by the provider versus which remain their responsibility
015:12.040 this shift can create temporary vulnerabilities during transition periods if not carefully managed one
015:19.520 powerful strategy for navigating these challenges is adopting a hybrid and
015:25.960 multicloud Architectural approach this strategy prevents vendor lock in by
015:31.920 allowing organizations to leverage the best services from multiple Cloud
015:37.120 providers while maintaining flexibility in their data management practices a healthc Care Organization
015:44.320 might use Google Cloud for its machine learning capabilities AWS for its
015:49.760 comprehensive data warehousing and maintain certain sensitive patient data on premises for Regulatory
015:57.480 Compliance implementing a successful multicloud strategy requires clear data
016:03.880 governance policies that span environments organizations need to establish consistent data definitions
016:11.520 quality standards and access controls that work across platforms interoperability becomes
016:18.400 critical data must flow seamlessly between environments without losing Integrity or context this of often
016:25.120 necessitates investing in abstraction layers that Shield business processes from the underlying technical
016:30.920 implementations data security in multicloud environments demands special attention each provider has unique
016:37.560 security controls and compliance certifications Architects must Implement
016:42.600 comprehensive security Frameworks that protect sensitive information consistently across platforms often
016:48.560 employing encryption tokenization and robust identity Management Solutions that work across Cloud boundaries
016:55.600 the payoff for effectively evolving architecture for cloud environments is
017:00.960 substantial uh organizations report improved agility and responsiveness to
017:06.800 changing business needs when marketing wants to launch a new campaign that
017:13.120 requires analyzing customer Behavior across multiple touch points a well
017:18.920 designed Cloud architecture can support this initiative in days rather than the
017:24.159 months it might take with traditional approaches teams collaborate more effectively when data is accessible
017:31.239 through Cloud platforms breaking down geographical and departmental barriers
017:36.600 the financial benefits are equally compelling statistics show that cloud migration can lead to significant
017:42.560 improvements in operational efficiency with companies reporting up to a 30% reduction in costs associated with data
017:49.760 storage and management after transitioning to cloud-based Solutions these savings come not just
017:56.080 from reduced infrastructure cost but from decreased maintenance overhead and improved resource utilization looking
018:02.639 Beyond immediate Cloud adoption future proofing your architecture requires designing systems that can easily
018:09.199 integrate emerging Technologies artificial intelligence and machine learning demand flexible data
018:16.080 architectures capable of handling diverse data types and enormous volumes
018:22.000 Edge Computing pushes processing closer to data sources requiring architectures
018:28.120 that can manage distributed processing while maintaining Central governance the
018:34.400 integration of AI functions directly into Enterprise data platforms is
018:39.480 becoming essential for organizations looking to scale their AI operations
018:45.760 this integration reduces latency and improves performance by keeping data
018:51.040 processing close to where data resides architectural approach approaches that separate data storage from AI processing
018:58.719 are increasingly giving way to unified platforms that support both functions
019:05.199 allowing for more sophisticated real-time analytics creating architectures
019:11.159 flexible enough to incorporate new data types and sources is another critical capability the explosion of iot devices
019:18.760 social media feeds video content and other unstructured data means architectures must adapt to ingest
019:26.000 process and analyze information that doesn't fit neatly into traditional database structures this flexibility
019:33.480 requires modular designs where components can be replaced or enhanced without disrupting the entire system
019:41.159 balancing standardization with Innovation presents another architectural challenge without
019:46.400 standards organizations risk creating fragmented incompatible systems that
019:53.239 undermine the value of their data yet excessive standardization can stifle
019:59.840 Innovation and slow adaptation to changing business needs successful architecture governance
020:07.560 establishes clear guard rails for security integration and data management
020:13.199 while allowing flexibility in implementation details architecture life
020:18.320 cycle management provides a structured approach to Evolution this process includes regular reassessment of
020:25.040 business needs technology capabilities and Architectural fit many organizations
020:31.480 Implement formal architecture review boards that meet quarterly to evaluate
020:36.840 emerging requirements and technological innovations these boards balance short-term project needs with long-term
020:44.080 architectural Vision ensuring individual decisions don't create fragmentation
020:49.600 over time a practical approach to architecture life cycle Management in
020:54.639 includes creating a modernization road mapap that sequences changes based on
0200.320 business impact and Technical dependencies rather than attempting
0205.760 wholesale transformation successful organizations identify high value
0211.040 components for modernization while maintaining compatibility with existing systems this
0217.360 incremental approach reduces risk while still moving the organization forward
0222.520 documentation practices also need to evolve for cloud environments traditional static architecture
0228.440 documents quickly become outdated in rapidly changing Cloud environments modern architecture documentation relies
0235.239 on automated tools that can generate current views of the environment showing actual implementations rather than

022:13.239 quality how we achieve those goals changes dramatically as Technologies
022:18.639 evolve but the principles themselves endure while the principles of data architecture in endure their value often
022:26.159 remains invisible to those controlling the budget ever wonder why One retail
022:31.360 company lost two full days of online sales with Revenue in the millions
022:36.880 simply because a database administrator changed a product code's data type
022:42.679 without understanding its business implications this wasn't just a technical failure it was a failure to
022:47.719 communicate architectures business value the gap between technical implementation
022:53.000 and business perception creates a dangerous disconnect data Architects
022:58.880 speak in terms of models patterns and Frameworks while Executives focus on
023:04.480 Revenue costs and competitive Advantage when these languages don't
023:09.600 translate architecture initiatives get viewed as cost centers rather than value
023:14.719 drivers leading to underfunding lack of organizational buyin and ultimately
023:21.199 failed projects this perception Pro problem isn't just frustrating it's
023:26.840 existential for data teams without a clear connection to business outcomes
023:32.320 even the most technically sound architecture becomes vulnerable to budget cuts and Leadership changes the
023:39.360 solution isn't to build better architectures it's to build Better Business cases that demonstrate tangible
023:46.400 value business capability mapping provides a powerful methodology for
023:52.199 bridging this Gap this approach approach aligns data architecture components
023:57.800 directly with organizational capabilities creating a visual representation of how data assets
024:05.159 support core business functions start by identifying your organization's key
024:11.239 capabilities customer acquisition product development Supply Chain management then map specific
024:18.360 architecture elements to each capability for example a customer data platform
024:23.560 doesn't exist isolation it directly enables customer segmentation
024:29.239 capabilities that drive personalized marketing by mapping the relationship
024:35.320 between the technical component and the business capability you transform
024:41.679 abstract architecture into concrete value
024:47.159 drivers this mapping exercise often reveals surprising insights about which
024:53.040 architectural elements deliver the most business impact helping prioritize

025:51.880 Revenue impact metrics measure how architecture enables new or expanded revenue streams for instance a unified
026:00.600 customer data model might enable cross- selling opportunities that increase
026:05.679 average transaction value by 15% by tracking this metric before and
026:11.679 after implementing the architecture you create a direct line from technical work to Topline growth cost efficiency
026:19.080 metrics quantify reduction in operational expenses through improved
026:24.360 data management an insurance company that clearly defined what a customer means across their organization didn't

028:25.520 what business initiatives would fail without proper architecture what competitive advantages would be
028:32.239 unrealized quantifying these opportunity costs provides compelling justification for proactive investment rather than

032:49.880 essential but it creates an uncomfortable reality many organ organizations avoid discussing every
032:55.920 time you strengthen data security you potentially sacrifice business agility yet 83% of companies that suffered major
033:03.560 breaches had actually prioritized accessibility over protection the
033:08.719 delicate balance between keeping data secure and keeping it useful represents architecture's most fundamental
033:15.360 challenge this tension plays out daily in organizations worldwide consider what
033:20.520 happens when your security team implements strict control on customer data marketing teams suddenly can't run
033:28.119 campaigns analysts struggle to generate insights and customer service Representatives find themselves unable
033:35.080 to resolve issues promptly conversely when access controls are too lacks sensitive information becomes vulnerable
033:42.600 to both external threats and internal misuse the solution lies not in choosing
033:47.920 between security and accessibility but in designing an architecture that delers
033:54.199 both appropriately this begins with embedding security considerations from
033:59.560 the very start of your architecture process rather than bolting them on later security by Design principles
034:07.400 ensure that protection mechanisms are woven into the fabric of your data architecture instead of becoming
034:12.760 obstacles layered on top of it one of the most powerful approaches to balancing security and accessibility is
034:19.920 implementing a data classification framework rather other than applying
034:25.080 uniform security controls across all information assets this framework
034:30.159 categorizes data based on sensitivity levels and then applies proportionate
034:36.760 protections for instance publicly available product information requires minimal safeguards while personally
034:44.119 identifiable customer details demand robust protection mechanisms this
034:49.560 nuanced approach prevents the overprotection of non-sensitive data
034:54.760 while ensuring critical information remains secure the classification process typically involves categorizing
035:01.119 data into tiers such as public internal confidential and restricted each tier
035:07.400 then receives appropriate controls aligned with its sensitivity level what
035:13.159 makes this approach particularly effective is that it allows organizations to focus their most
035:19.000 stringent security measures where they matter most without creating
035:24.400 unnecessary friction for everyday business operations involving less sensitive
035:30.800 information implementing leas privilege access models represents another Cornerstone of balanced security
035:37.560 architecture this principle dictates that users should have access only to the specific data required for their
035:44.440 roles nothing more nothing less when properly implemented least privilege
035:49.600 models dramatically reduce the risk surface while still enabling leg legitimate users to perform their
035:55.199 functions efficiently the implementation begins with role-based access control
036:01.239 rbac which assigns permissions based on job functions rather than individual
036:08.040 identities this can be further refined with attribute-based Access Control ABAC
036:14.760 which considers contextual factors like location time of day and device security
036:22.199 posture when making access decisions the most sophisticated organizations are now
036:28.280 implementing Dynamic access models that continuously evaluate risk factors and
036:34.239 adjust permissions accordingly a healthcare organization demonstrated the
036:39.360 power of this approach when they redesigned their data architecture to
036:44.920 implement granular access controls rather than giving clinicians
036:50.080 access to all patient records the system now grants access only to records of
036:57.000 patients under their care this change reduced unauthorized
037:02.440 access incidents by 76% while actually improving clinician Satisfaction by
037:08.360 presenting them with more relevant information secure data sharing across organizational boundaries presents
037:15.800 particularly complex challenges modern business ecosystems require the exchange of
037:23.239 information information with Partners suppliers customers and Regulators each
037:28.960 with different security requirements and capabilities building architectures that
037:34.480 enable this exchange without compromising security demands thoughtful design data virtualization Technologies
037:42.080 offer one solution by providing a logical abstraction layer that can apply
037:47.599 security policies consistently across diverse data sources rather than
037:52.679 physically moving sensitive data between environments virtualization allows
037:57.840 controlled access to information while it remains in its secure original
038:03.040 location this approach reduces the proliferation of sensitive data copies
038:08.119 while maintaining security controls API based data exchange represents another architectural pattern
038:15.520 that balances security with accessibility well-designed apis can
038:21.119 enforce security policies validate requests limit data exposure and create
038:28.000 audit Trails while still enabling seamless integration between systems
038:33.080 their standardized interfaces also make security testing and monitoring more
038:38.560 straightforward compared to ad hoc data transfers Beyond these architectural
038:44.560 approaches privacy enhancing Technologies PS provide powerful
038:49.840 mechanisms for protecting sensitive information while still enabling analytics and data sharing these
038:56.800 Technologies allow organizations to derive value from data without exposing the underlying sensitive information
039:04.040 differential privacy techniques add precisely calculated noise to data sets making it impossible to identify
039:10.560 individuals while preserving statistical validity for analytics homomorphic encryption allows
039:17.400 computation directly on encrypted data without decryption enabling secure analysis of sensitive information
039:24.159 Federated learning permits building machine learning models across multiple
039:29.920 uh data sources without centralizing sensitive data meanwhile tokenization
039:35.440 replaces sensitive values with non-sensitive equivalents that maintain
039:40.480 relationships and patterns without exposing the original information a financial services institution
039:46.040 implemented Federated learning to analyze customer Behavior patterns across several Regional Banks without
039:52.280 centralizing sens itive transaction data this approach allowed them to develop

042:18.000 No text
042:23.800 isn't about technical Perfection it's about creating a foundation for better
042:29.599 decision making what truly transforms organizations is how data models bridge
042:36.239 the gap between business requirements and Technical implementations when data models
042:42.000 effectively articulate Core Business rules they become powerful communication tools that align teams around shared
042:50.400 understanding I've witnessed this firsthand when two merging insurance companies used shared data models to
042:57.679 successfully integrate their systems uh turning what could have been a chaotic
043:03.000 process into a streamline transition the path forward isn't about
043:08.280 implementing everything at once start where you are prioritize business outcomes and build incrementally
043:14.639 remember that data architecture is a continuous journey of improvement not a destination

# Lesson 156 - Zachman Framework in 10 Minutes
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/IaQddw-uCvY

00.960 hello everyone and welcome to software
03.720 architecture Monday my name is Mark
05.819 Richards and in this lesson number 156 I
09.599 thought I'd switch over to do a little
11.580 bit of more Enterprise architecture
13.500 related topics and talk about the
16.079 zachman framework and I'm going to try
18.240 to accomplish this in 10 minutes but I
20.820 may I may go just another minute or two
23.160 longer
24.680 but you can get a listing of all the
27.060 lessons I do on software architecture
29.279 Monday uh through my website at
32.119 developer2architect.com
33.739 lessons and here you can view the videos
36.260 or you can link over to YouTube a lot of
40.140 the material I do
42.000 um especially recently pull from these
43.980 two books but these two don't include
46.379 anything about Enterprise architecture
48.660 so that's why I wanted to really talk
50.940 about the zachman framework
53.520 all right so the zachman Enterprise
56.340 framework is an architecture framework
58.500 that was developed a long time ago in
000.840 1992 by John zachman from IBM and it has
005.220 evolved quite a bit actually well
007.380 obviously quite a bit several times
009.479 since its initial development and it's
013.619 still very useful today I get a lot of
017.520 questions from clients that say what
021.000 sort of architecture framework would you
023.040 recommend us using I know there's togaf
025.860 and that is the open group applic
027.840 architecture framework but are there
030.720 others should we consider zachman and
032.700 I've also worked in a lot of engagements
034.380 that have used zachman so I kind of want
036.540 to talk about the Dynamics of it and
038.400 give a little bit of my well pros and
040.680 cons kind of criticism
043.020 um the zachman framework is a taxonomy
045.119 of models uh very small models that are
048.659 put together and as a matter of fact it
050.820 really consists of two different
053.220 dimensions uh there's different
055.259 perspectives views of the Enterprise
057.860 from let's say the executive perspective
02:01.079 business architect that's where kind of
02:03.720 most of us listening would be in the
02:06.240 engineering perspective and Technical
02:08.098 perspective then there's a list of
02:11.280 models and these answer the core main
02:14.160 questions in the universe what how where
02:17.220 who when and why
02:21.500 the biggest
02:23.220 um initial
02:25.080 um challenge I would say of the zachman
02:27.540 Enterprise framework is knowing um what
02:30.959 goes in each model for each perspective
02:33.840 and because what you see here are all
02:36.840 these grids which in which we place
02:39.000 various models now this is one advantage
02:41.640 I've seen of zachman is that the models
02:44.459 tend to be small and well scoped so I
02:47.280 can look at one grid for a specific
02:49.200 purpose but what I want to really do
02:51.360 here is take a look and show you what
02:54.420 each of these models contain within each
02:57.840 perspective it kind of helps give us a
03:00.239 sense of what's modeled within the
03:02.819 zachman Enterprise framework let's start
03:05.640 with the what piece this is the very
03:07.680 first model that sits and this is all
03:10.560 about inventory sets and entities
03:12.659 basically it's lists of things I find
03:16.739 this model very very useful especially
03:19.860 coming in to a new and engagement or if
03:23.159 a new CIO comes in or CTO this is the
03:26.459 first thing they want is give me an
03:28.379 inventory of what we have
03:30.239 and
03:31.739 the executive perspective are things
03:33.659 entities in the business that are
03:35.760 important to them the business
03:37.620 perspective are business entities and
03:39.780 and what those are the architect
03:42.180 perspective are really the applications
03:44.220 and databases these are the system
03:46.319 entities that support those business
03:49.140 entities
03:50.879 um that go up to the executive level now
03:53.400 the engineering perspective and
03:55.140 Technical start getting confusing and
03:57.720 that's where I like these categories but
03:59.940 the engineering is a list of the various
04:01.560 Technologies and platforms not the
04:04.440 systems that's the architect's
04:06.299 perspective the engineering perspective
04:08.459 is what's used to implement those
04:11.640 particular systems and finally the
04:13.319 technical perspective is all about
04:15.000 infrastructure this is our inventory of
04:17.940 Hardware networks
04:19.680 um maybe if we're in Cloud which Cloud
04:21.600 providers which Services stuff like that
04:24.780 okay so the what I find very useful now
04:28.440 the how really describes various
04:31.259 processes
04:33.360 um processes both technical but also
04:35.639 non-technical and let me show you what I
04:37.560 mean
04:38.340 so the executive perspective this is the
04:40.620 highest level the most General type of
04:42.780 major business processes the business
04:44.759 performs this would be a list of all for
04:47.820 example the lines of business
04:49.919 and what processes are critical for our
04:52.680 business the business perspective starts
04:55.680 to show those workflow models the
04:57.419 business process models
04:59.220 um how do you place an order for example
05:01.440 how do we process a claim the fact that
05:04.560 we process claims would be a good
05:06.479 example of an executive perspective
05:08.820 the business perspective is what are the
05:11.340 workflows for how to do those
05:13.620 um the architect's perspective these are
05:15.720 the system dependencies how
05:18.479 do systems interrelate and what is the
05:21.419 communication between those and the
05:23.100 process flows that exist between systems
05:26.100 and services the engineering perspective
05:28.919 goes down to the build and release
05:30.800 procedures and practices this is where
05:34.020 we would describe our CI CD pipeline for
05:36.900 example and finally the technical is
05:39.060 really all about infrastructure I need a
05:42.360 new server how do I procure that and
05:44.759 notice anytime I ask how
05:47.160 it's a different perspective
05:49.740 and goes into one of these models if I
05:52.320 need to know how to let's say create a
05:55.919 new development environment in AWS I can
05:58.680 go straight to that model right there
06:00.539 and that tells me how to do that
06:03.419 now the where becomes one of the most
06:06.240 confusing models in zachman but this is
06:09.720 all about distribution networks in other
06:11.820 words where do things happen
06:14.580 from an executive perspective it's the
06:16.680 list of all the physical locations that
06:18.660 we operate hey you know something that's
06:21.060 actually quite useful useful to know are
06:24.180 we Global and if we are Global what
06:26.639 cities or countries do we have offices
06:28.620 in or locations in the business
06:31.020 perspective is really all about those
06:33.300 business process Logistics across the
06:35.880 locations in other words where do
06:38.759 certain things happen
06:41.160 the where from an architect's
06:43.020 perspective is our distributed systems
06:45.660 architecture again we're taking that
06:47.580 business process and saying
06:49.860 um which system is processing this part
06:52.860 of the workflow and this is all about
06:54.780 where our Enterprise Integration would
06:57.300 actually happen an engineering
06:59.280 perspective is where our teams are
07:00.900 located do we use offshore teams uh do
07:04.020 we have remote teams where are their
07:05.759 locations how do they interrelate and
07:08.580 finally our physical topology are we
07:11.940 cloud-based on-prem do we have a data
07:13.979 center where is it and so that asks kind
07:16.199 of the where piece and so we're only
07:18.419 halfway done but you can kind of get a
07:20.220 sense of how this model really gives you
07:22.440 a full 100 picture of what's Happening
07:27.660 now the who starts to also become a
07:30.720 confusing model what do we what do we
07:32.940 put in the who but these are actors but
07:36.000 more importantly responsibility for
07:38.819 areas in other words these are a list of
07:41.220 the organizational units that are
07:43.199 important to the business who does what
07:46.860 for the business perspective it's the
07:49.380 actor model basically product owners
07:51.479 would exist within here as well as which
07:54.660 actors act upon different parts of the
07:58.080 workflow and systems
08:00.900 so from the architect's perspective
08:03.360 who owns what
08:06.000 who's responsible as the architect for
08:09.000 the claims processing subsystem who's
08:11.819 responsible for our customer domain
08:14.340 functionality and that's those kind of
08:16.380 questions would be answered here and
08:18.000 modeled through here now the engineering
08:20.520 is really about the application
08:22.440 ownership but more because that overlaps
08:26.819 a little bit with architecture
08:28.020 perspective I like the engineering
08:30.360 perspective on the who is our groups our
08:33.179 logical security model who is allowed to
08:36.839 do what within those systems not
08:40.200 necessarily responsible for those
08:41.940 systems but now we're talking about
08:43.679 security and access control and finally
08:46.800 infrastructure owners and their
08:48.540 responsibility who do I contact to get
08:51.959 that Network started up okay two more
08:55.500 models to go the when talks about timing
08:59.220 cycles and dependencies again it's a
09:01.680 brilliant framework from this
09:02.820 perspective because it really includes
09:05.040 everything that's really necessary event
09:07.620 cycles that are important to the
09:09.180 business whether it be monthly or
09:10.860 quarterly or even weekly or nightly
09:13.440 processes that the business has to do
09:15.959 from the business perspective these are
09:18.540 all the processing schedules for the
09:20.160 workflows when workflows happen
09:22.800 the architect's perspective are timing
09:25.200 dependencies between systems when those
09:27.959 systems may come down or when they're
09:29.820 needed this is the part here in the
09:32.700 architect's perspective where we would
09:34.560 put things about availability needs and
09:36.720 availability dependencies
09:39.019 application availability and
09:40.860 dependencies at a lower level really go
09:43.620 to the engineering perspective and
09:45.600 finally the technical or the
09:47.399 availability and timing cycles of when
09:49.680 things come down for backups for example
09:52.920 and I saved in my opinion the best
09:57.420 and most important model for last
10:01.320 and I hope you've stayed tuned because
10:03.660 this model right here is my favorite and
10:07.800 that is the Y model I love this model as
10:10.920 a matter of fact I usually do a lot of
10:13.200 toe Gaff rather than zachman but within
10:15.720 the toe Gaff model I actually add
10:18.500 zachman's y model
10:21.240 to the ADM and let me explain this is
10:24.959 the motivation intentions
10:27.360 um the executive perspective are the
10:29.399 list of important goals and strategies
10:31.500 where we want to take the business that
10:33.959 is critical especially as an architect
10:36.120 to know the business perspective
10:39.480 are the business segments or those
10:41.820 departments or division objectives and
10:44.279 what their plan is
10:45.899 to achieve some of those business goals
10:47.940 and strategies the architect perspective
10:50.820 is where we put our assertions and
10:53.399 justifications for architecture
10:55.860 decisions that we make architectural
10:59.040 refactorings that we do that's the
101.620 architect's perspective of why are we
104.140 doing micro services for example
107.260 um the engineering perspective is the
109.480 capabilities that we're putting into
111.339 those systems
112.959 we're choosing a micro Services
114.700 architecture I have a why piece for that
117.700 a justification
119.079 but when we start adding functionality
121.500 why is that functionality there and this
124.660 is where a lot of Enterprise Architects
126.459 derive that capabilities assertions or
129.940 the capabilities model to it and finally
134.140 the technical infrastructure we're going
137.200 to migrate migrate to Cloud would be a
139.300 technical perspective why are we
142.360 migrating to Cloud these in my opinion
145.019 as most of you who listen to me know are
148.600 the most important questions
151.240 to ask and there you have it I'm not
154.720 sure what the timing is here I'll find
156.160 out in a little bit when I when I stop
158.019 recording
159.100 um but that is the zachman Enterprise
12:00.839 framework I'm really useful as a
12:03.180 taxonomy now it's not a process it's not
12:05.820 showing you how to do certain things but
12:08.279 a great way of modeling the Enterprise
12:10.860 and having these really important pieces
12:13.920 of information at hand
12:16.680 all right so this has been lesson 156 a
12:19.740 little deviation because I haven't done
12:21.540 Enterprise architecture in a while so I
12:23.640 actually wanted to kind of start out by
12:25.800 showing zachmann framework in 10 minutes
12:28.620 um so thank you so much for listening
12:30.180 stay tuned in two more weeks for another
12:32.579 lesson in software architecture Monday
12:35.160 thank you

05.740 [Music]
16.480 good afternoon everyone uh thank you for
18.720 joining this webinar so i have a
20.400 privilege to share about the topics one
23.039 developing and
24.880 effective enterprise architecture
26.160 framework for financial services so
28.000 actually my presentation uh today is
30.240 taken from a real implementation in one
33.520 of the bank how to set up a enterprise
36.239 architecture framework basically the
38.480 bank most of the bank
40.399 i don't think any of the bank don't have
42.000 enterprise architecture but they
43.440 function differently so what happened is
45.600 that when uh the digital enterprise
47.840 architecture being introduced introduced
49.600 then there will be some sort of
51.120 alignment and also reorganization and
53.600 also
54.399 restructuring the entire architecture
57.360 so uh yeah this topic about uh i will
000.320 finish it maybe less than half an hour
001.840 but i will just highlight what a
003.840 so-called task and uh typical impact
006.560 that uh when the digital enterprise
008.159 architecture uh coming into a typical
010.560 bank
012.159 so let me just take about one minute to
014.000 introduce who we are so i think we are
015.680 from atd and uh i am heading the the
019.119 group of the company so we are
021.040 specializing in the consulting coaching
023.360 training and also running the event like
024.799 this for of course around the topic of
026.720 enterprise architecture which is what
028.720 our passion and what we are specializing
031.680 in so we do also offer a very
033.759 comprehensive training and certification
035.759 program for enterprise architecture
037.680 suites from business architect
039.439 information software infrastructure
041.119 solution
042.880 and also all the
044.720 information on data architecture
046.640 so we offered a program from the
049.200 business architect archimedes and the
051.119 enterprise architecture framework itself
052.880 and of course the governance yeah
054.479 because our enterprise architecture
055.840 cannot run from the government itself
057.439 like a corbett
059.439 certified
02:00.560 and of course all the debt orbs and
02:02.370 [Music]
02:03.920 today the context of the ipo
02:07.040 to support the so-called afterlife when
02:09.360 we go live the system so there will be
02:10.878 some sort of a framework to support the
02:12.720 operation like to meet sla and et cetera
02:15.120 so we do offer a comprehensive uh
02:17.200 training
02:18.640 so these are some of our clients so
02:20.480 actually we have more than this but this
02:21.000 No text
02:22.160 is just one of the highlight that the
02:23.920 winner of the open group awards into
02:25.920 zero one again two zero one nine so last
02:27.920 year to zero 2020 they didn't have an
02:29.680 award so this user might not have but
02:31.680 actually i think they might have another
02:33.040 award
02:33.840 so hopefully we can
02:36.800 submit more of a successful case study
02:39.040 for this type of the prestigious award
02:41.599 and this is some of the client that has
02:43.680 a so-called subscribe to gartner and
02:46.319 and and what happened is that all the
02:47.840 enterprise architecture are being guided
02:50.800 supervised and reviewed by the gardener
02:52.560 itself
02:54.640 and these are the software the award of
02:56.319 last year so this year they have a 2021
02:58.239 award so already closed so let's see how
03:00.720 many of our clients can win this award
03:03.040 so these are two uh last year
03:05.280 uh two of our uh clients are won in the
03:08.319 top ten year awards
03:10.159 yeah
03:10.879 for pomodoro
03:13.519 so the rest are some of the clients
03:16.480 in singapore malaysia indonesia hong
03:19.120 kong
03:20.560 so let me just go straight into the
03:22.239 context so these are the typical content
03:24.000 No text
03:24.400 if you are working as an enterprise
03:25.599 architecture in typical financial
03:27.920 services in the bank right so they have
03:30.640 so you need to be aligned with the
03:32.319 strategy business data and technology so
03:34.480 basic basically these are so-called uh
03:37.040 high-level uh context where the
03:39.120 architect typically being put in yeah so
03:41.680 for instance in term of the strategy so
03:45.120 basically is that architect expected to
03:47.680 answer such a question right what is the
03:50.080 outcome of the strategy
03:51.760 and of course people may ask which
03:53.599 business capability to help to fulfill
03:55.760 this strategy can we answer that or
03:58.319 which application play an important role
04:00.000 for the strategy because say we might
04:02.239 ask for the budget but
04:04.239 how does that help my strategy if you're
04:06.480 asking for the key stakeholders so we
04:08.239 need to be able to answer that and in
04:09.920 terms of the business of course the
04:11.439 question like is the current business uh
04:14.000 process automated because i heard some
04:16.639 of the uh process are still
04:18.720 semi-automated right customers have
04:20.560 complained here and the system cannot
04:22.320 access that they have to go to login
04:23.759 local et cetera so these are the typical
04:25.759 questions that uh circle race in terms
04:28.160 of the business and of course the
04:29.600 process flow
04:30.800 as well as okay which application that
04:32.800 currently supporting the business
04:33.919 process show me the map
04:35.600 can we answer that
04:37.120 so these are the typical question that
04:38.720 the trigger all the architects if you
04:41.440 are working in the typical uh financial
04:43.520 services
04:44.880 and of course in terms of the data where
04:46.880 is the source of data can you tell me
04:49.919 and then why is so complicated to create
04:51.360 this report i just want to get this
04:52.479 report why taking two months can't we
04:54.639 just get it tomorrow right someone asks
04:56.960 you three o'clock can we just
04:58.560 deploy tomorrow you still don't know how
05:00.639 to get the data
05:02.080 so these are something that uh uh real
05:04.880 and it's actually it's non-trivial
05:06.240 question but become a big deal if you
05:08.160 don't have a proper so-called digital ea
05:10.880 in place
05:12.000 of course of the technology what will
05:13.360 happen to my business if this
05:14.720 application is done which application
05:16.800 integrates with with this application
05:18.639 right i need to know all
05:20.320 so how do we answer this
05:22.880 of course to answer this question
05:24.000 therefore thing you need to be uh a
05:25.000 No text
05:26.320 soccer partner financial services bank
05:28.080 need to establish
05:29.600 first is that content metamodel do we
05:32.720 have the structure of enter our
05:34.240 enterprise so content
05:35.600 motor model i can just equip with the
05:37.919 entity relationship for the particular
05:39.440 system but i'm talking here about the
05:41.039 particular enterprise
05:42.880 do we have that view do we have the
05:44.720 design if not we can answer just now the
05:47.199 previous question that i explained in
05:48.720 the previous slide so we need to have
05:50.479 some sort of the metamodel to get it
05:52.080 right because without this will be the
05:54.160 headless chicken and we have become a
05:55.840 reactive
05:57.039 the second one i think year process so
05:58.880 this is something very very important so
06:00.880 we need to know the process and the life
06:02.240 cycle so this is talking about of course
06:04.400 the framework the methodology and all
06:07.120 the blueprint that we need to have in
06:09.199 place
06:10.720 then the next one is the governance so
06:13.039 all the thing that we are putting in
06:14.800 place the content and process we need to
06:16.319 be governed if not governed everyone can
06:18.560 do whatever they like and especially is
06:21.280 the in the financial services they are
06:22.639 very uh stringent in term of the audit
06:25.520 and also review and compliance right
06:27.440 with the central bank so we need to have
06:29.600 so-called government in place and the
06:31.039 government itself need to be so-called
06:32.880 automated in most of the cases we don't
06:35.759 do manual intervention unless necessary
06:38.800 and of course last but not least the
06:40.639 correct uh right ea repository which is
06:43.759 what most of the organization is that
06:45.520 they have some sort of repository but
06:47.440 there's some using excel and some using
06:49.680 the repository but they don't configure
06:51.599 correctly so all these like quantum
06:53.759 metamodel process governance need to be
06:55.759 embedded into the repository to get the
06:58.080 maximum outcome of our enterprise
07:00.479 architecture so that the previous quest
07:02.880 uh slide that i expressed we can answer
07:05.360 that to the key stakeholders as and when
07:07.440 they demand us launcher otherwise
07:09.280 architect really uh you know catch off
07:11.520 guard and which boss can give me one
07:13.680 week okay one week we might not get the
07:16.000 job that's the reality of life today
07:18.560 right the management asking us
07:20.800 i can give you tomorrow you tell me one
07:22.160 week forget it
07:23.280 you better you better update your cv no
07:24.880 kidding but the reality is that we need
07:26.880 to be fast responsive and also we need
07:29.360 to be a so-called uh proactive in our
07:32.080 engagement
07:34.000 and this of course require a framework
07:35.000 No text
07:36.080 right that's not all the processed
07:37.280 methodology so we need to have some sort
07:38.800 of framework so one other thing is
07:39.919 photograph so i believe uh this is the
07:41.919 widely used uh framework so i believe
07:44.000 some of you in this
07:45.759 webinar already are together certified
07:47.199 so let me just highlight right just to
07:48.720 give you a refresher so basically in
07:51.120 terms of preliminary we need to make
07:52.720 sure that always get the management
07:54.160 buy-in because we cannot do architecture
07:56.400 bottom-up yes we can but very tiring
07:58.639 trust me i've come across a map of
08:00.639 people that want to do bottom up
08:02.560 the journey is very very tough and pain
08:04.639 right it's i don't know when i can move
08:06.639 up to the next level
08:08.000 so we need to be able to get the right
08:09.680 management support and then we need to
08:11.199 get established the principle
08:13.120 then after that of course preparing the
08:14.560 entire organization to go through the
08:16.319 transformation
08:17.759 so when we go talking about phase a b c
08:20.479 d in the photograph we call it about
08:22.160 architecture building block circuit
08:23.759 distributing block of course first is
08:25.280 that we need to know the vision and the
08:26.800 strategy so where are the organization
08:28.800 is heading
08:30.000 today
08:30.879 in the running a digital transformation
08:33.039 once we know that then we can understand
08:35.279 what are the business need to change so
08:37.039 so whatever thing need to change i we
08:38.880 consider it as a gaps right so we
08:41.120 develop the business architects again
08:42.799 then after that of course logically we
08:44.560 look at the data information gap and
08:46.640 then software or application gap and
08:48.640 last but not least technology or
08:50.320 infrastructure again if you see here the
08:52.080 order abcd many iit people actually they
08:54.720 are very comfortable in the c and d
08:56.640 right they're just talking about data
08:58.160 talking application about technology
08:59.839 about infrastructure but they don't
09:01.920 really understand or they they're afraid
09:05.440 to jump in into the a and b which is
09:07.360 talking about enterprise vision and
09:08.720 strategy and of course business
09:10.320 architecture but without a and b
09:12.640 whatever we do in the c and d
09:14.640 we're talking about data application and
09:16.320 technology we deliver little value
09:18.560 because the senior management can only
09:20.080 see the value in the a and b which is in
09:22.800 terms of the enterprise fusion and the
09:24.560 strategy as well as in the business
09:26.560 architecture itself so once this is done
09:28.560 then we can develop a solution so
09:30.959 solution we are talking here about the
09:32.640 first thing first we consolidate all the
09:34.320 gap because we know the a
09:36.399 the inter division then in the bcd we go
09:38.720 the gap so the gap will be consolidated
09:40.320 become a project so this project becomes
09:42.080 a transformation project then of course
09:44.000 in the f we're getting the project plan
09:46.160 assign the theme and we
09:48.320 basically got the all the tasks
09:50.959 then in the g is where the duration of
09:52.800 the project so in the project seven
09:54.080 months then architect will look and
09:56.160 supervise to make sure that compliant is
09:58.000 there right so i have a diagram to
09:59.519 illustrate this in the next half of
10:00.560 slide and if there's any changes changes
10:03.360 it becomes part of life
10:05.360 because some people are asking that oh
10:06.880 my organization is very random i don't
10:08.480 think need architecture well the more
10:10.480 dynamic you are the more you need
10:11.760 architecture if you'll be if your
10:13.120 organization never changed in the last
10:15.200 five years donate architecture why
10:17.360 everything will change
10:19.040 when the thing changes for us is where
10:20.640 you need the architects right you need
10:22.240 the architecture to keep track of the
10:23.600 changes to make sure that all the
10:24.800 changes are controlled related and all
10:26.880 the changes can be integrated and in the
10:29.760 holistic manner to support the business
10:32.160 goal
10:33.760 so in terms of the layers of course
10:34.000 No text
10:35.120 we're talking about here the argument
10:36.399 right so ultimate business layer
10:37.920 application layer technology layer and
10:40.160 of course the strategy and motivation
10:41.600 layer and implementation and migration
10:43.120 layer so all these layers are i mean
10:45.839 because architecture is
10:47.600 addressing a complexity of the real
10:49.200 world to address or to simplify the real
10:52.079 world complexity we need to make it
10:53.680 simple so one other way is to make it
10:55.600 layer
10:57.120 so of course when we're talking about
10:59.200 this um enterprise architecture itself
101.600 in the financial services you cannot run
103.360 away from security especially today's
104.800 cyber security so cyber security itself
107.040 is not only at the network right many
108.720 people think i just leave it to the uh
110.800 to the
111.760 to the hosting guy to settle no we have
114.160 to handle right from the business itself
116.560 then look at the data application and
117.839 technology basically all the domain of
119.200 architecture need to be
121.120 looked after in terms of the security
122.880 cannot be just after talk process
126.000 No text
126.480 and this is an example on how you
128.240 address a uh enterprise architecture so
131.200 if you divide between the eap and the
133.519 security team right so security if you
135.760 think like your security are
137.760 a big size team then you can appoint as
140.399 an architect right but architect insult
142.160 can be part of the enterprise
143.839 architecture okay so that one is
145.040 dependent on your organization's
146.000 structure
146.959 so typically in the preliminary and the
148.880 vision is that you understand about the
150.720 business driver you define the business
152.720 objectives security principle risk
154.560 appetite and security resource plan so
156.720 these are very very important because
158.720 why at the point in time we know the
12:00.480 vision and the strategy of the
12:01.680 organization this way we can tailor our
12:04.320 security right so if the senior
12:06.720 management said that security is not
12:08.240 their concern then we can loosen a bit
12:09.920 but doesn't mean we open up the door but
12:11.360 we loosen a bit but the security is
12:13.120 number one and we can tighten the whole
12:15.040 uh process etc once you understand at
12:17.680 the top level then we can embed the
12:19.200 security in our business
12:20.959 okay how are we going to run this
12:22.880 then after that we can embed into our
12:25.040 data and application as well uh as well
12:27.760 as all the interfaces with the security
12:30.560 team right so like identity management
12:32.240 continuity management security
12:34.160 monitoring compliance etc
12:36.240 then we can look at the
12:38.959 infrastructure the technology itself
12:41.279 rather than you know we start with the
12:43.279 technology or application but we do uh
12:46.240 the rest first
12:47.600 then of course we are looking at the
12:48.959 requirement right talking about
12:50.160 requirement we are looking at the
12:51.200 business attribute control and etcetera
12:53.760 then during the project we need to look
12:56.079 at the mitigation what are mitigation
12:58.480 plan that we can develop
13:00.880 and of course
13:01.920 look at the when you come up the project
13:03.760 plan you look at the assessment yeah and
13:06.240 of course the loop and the
13:07.040 implementation look at the security
13:08.240 audit and compliance and in the change
13:10.320 management we look at the entire
13:12.320 governance okay so this is just example
13:15.040 that in the typical organization where
13:18.480 security uh being applied into the
13:20.720 architecture so you look everything is
13:22.800 the structure right it's not that you
13:24.639 give it to the security guy two person
13:26.160 running around and then talk with the
13:27.440 vendor installing all the patches etc we
13:29.200 don't know what happened so we need to
13:31.200 have some sort of the architecture
13:32.639 embedded as part of the entire
13:34.800 organization
13:36.959 and this is one of the so-called
13:38.000 No text
13:39.440 pictures in terms of the executing a
13:41.600 strategy and the execution so typically
13:44.480 just now you look at the top of itself
13:48.240 that they got the vision they got the
13:49.680 business um application data and the
13:52.320 infrastructure so this is where uh
13:54.639 basically you can look at the so-called
13:57.120 the connectivity between the strategy
13:58.959 and execution so the bridge is actually
14:01.600 take place in the middle business
14:03.600 capability right then i think uh this is
14:06.079 where also uh one of the uh
14:09.519 key uh
14:11.040 frameworks today that are being used a
14:13.040 lot in the financial services across the
14:14.880 globe uh which is beyond okay so beyond
14:17.519 i think we are very fortunate i think uh
14:19.120 the next two the next speaker uh patrick
14:22.079 will be sharing with you the vr and then
14:23.760 of course i will be also doing a
14:25.040 moderating at the last session to asking
14:26.800 him more and if you have any question
14:28.480 about vr i think you can take this
14:30.240 opportunity to uh check uh
14:33.040 uh and also type in your question
14:35.680 so basically the alignment is between
14:37.519 enterprise vision to the it project it's
14:39.839 very very important because people said
14:41.440 what's the value of this network what's
14:42.720 the value of this system if we cannot
14:44.480 connect to the business capability then
14:47.120 it is very difficult to generate value
14:49.199 because because from the business
14:50.399 capability we can connect to the
14:51.680 strategy and the vision okay so this is
14:53.680 where the the bridge between business
14:57.040 and technology because in the past we
14:58.720 always think like how to integrate
15:00.320 business and technology
15:01.839 so the answer is the business capability
15:03.519 is one of the way to effectively uh
15:06.000 so-called establish this
15:08.720 so this is an example on the capability
15:10.800 map in the in the typical bank so uh
15:11.000 No text
15:13.519 this particular bank consumer banking
15:15.680 department have a full capability okay
15:18.079 so they can develop and manage product
15:19.600 services market uh sell product and
15:22.160 manage id as well as manage financial
15:24.320 resources so here of course can also be
15:27.199 looked at the dependency right so
15:29.519 consumer making in the in the middle
15:30.959 supported by the full capability and we
15:33.440 can also look for instance for instance
15:35.199 at this type of the capability map so
15:37.440 this capability map is very very
15:38.880 important in terms of our structure in
15:41.839 the particular bank
15:44.000 so we look at the capability in terms of
15:47.199 the so-called the map itself because
15:49.759 this map is not standalone but this map
15:51.680 is connected to the rest of the
15:52.880 organization to the strategy to the
15:54.480 application to the to the
15:57.040 infrastructure to the data to the
15:58.720 business and etcetera
16:01.040 so
16:01.839 for instance this is a example in the
16:04.000 content metamodel that the first thing
16:05.680 first that i mentioned
16:07.279 every uh bank need to have so they need
16:09.839 to define their structure of uh their
16:12.880 physical bank itself so actually after
16:15.680 we get this we can we can quickly
16:18.000 generate a so-called digital twin of
16:20.480 your particular bank yeah so this one is
16:23.360 where if you see the legend on the left
16:26.000 so the legend on the left is that they
16:27.519 got what they call it a motivation
16:29.600 strategy business application technology
16:32.079 implementation and migration these are
16:33.680 actually the layers in the enterprise
16:35.440 right so in anything that you do you can
16:38.000 you can connect back to these uh
16:39.600 particular layers
16:41.600 so this actually we're using
16:43.279 it so we model the motivation strategy
16:46.320 capability map the organization
16:48.000 viewpoint business function viewpoint
16:50.320 and go contribution uh viewpoint as well
16:53.519 as all the processors and the technology
16:56.639 you set itself so this is just one
16:58.560 example that every organization need to
17:00.880 have if you want to define the structure
17:02.720 if you can have this definition
17:04.720 correctly defined
17:06.160 then you can configure it into the
17:07.839 repository and you can run the so-called
17:10.160 uh the real digital ea so all the
17:12.480 questions just now the senior management
17:14.640 asking about in my first two slides you
17:17.199 can answer it quickly so this is
17:19.119 actually uh the key for a successful
17:21.919 digital ear setup
17:24.400 so example under this particular
17:25.000 No text
17:26.400 strategy right so these are basically
17:27.919 every department run their own strategy
17:29.600 and so for those of you who are not
17:30.799 familiar with this this is actually the
17:31.919 symbol from archimede so you need to
17:33.840 have defined this right so we understand
17:35.760 zoom in for instance for the first uh
17:38.400 for the payment right for the payment uh
17:40.880 layers
17:41.760 strategy layers so we can understand
17:43.840 that this particular payment supported
17:46.080 by many many capabilities yeah so one of
17:48.480 the capabilities itself it will realize
17:50.160 the outcome and the outcome we also
17:52.080 realize the business goal and the
17:53.360 business goal belong to the particular
17:55.360 department so this is one of the way on
17:57.760 how we can show how the architecture
18:01.039 itself the capability can help to
18:03.200 achieve the goal of the particular key
18:04.640 stakeholders and of course later
18:06.080 capability will be supported by many
18:07.679 many of the technology or application or
18:09.600 data
18:11.440 so in this instance this is one of the
18:13.360 snapshot on a particular application
18:14.000 No text
18:15.440 portfolio in a typical bank right so
18:17.440 it's i purposely make it small so you
18:18.880 don't you can't really see but this is
18:20.799 actually uh just one of the portfolio of
18:22.960 the co-banking
18:24.799 then if we zoom in into the particular
18:27.520 area right so every core banking
18:29.760 component itself actually supporting
18:31.679 particular capability and this is very
18:33.360 very important like just now the mapping
18:35.679 because after we define the meta model
18:37.120 so we know exactly where are the
18:38.640 dependency where are the impact analysis
18:40.799 so if i change particular application i
18:43.360 know exactly which capabilities impacted
18:45.679 and how the capability impact particular
18:47.600 key standards how the capability impact
18:49.679 the business and et cetera et cetera
18:53.120 so this uh so-called typical ea function
18:54.000 No text
18:56.160 in the uh many of the ea actually ea
18:59.679 team uh acting as a governance right as
19:02.080 a solution uh team so these are just one
19:05.039 example as is as is mean in many
19:07.280 organizations or many banks today that i
19:08.720 come across they are typically set up
19:10.480 like this
19:11.600 so they have a so-called project
19:12.799 prioritization right so they've got the
19:14.320 pmo
19:15.520 and they start the project they kick up
19:17.520 the project so ea actually just been
19:19.440 calling right to review the project okay
19:22.480 then in the during project execution so
19:24.240 ea team sometimes being called sometimes
19:26.000 don't be sometimes i'm not being caught
19:27.679 at all okay so your team you've been
19:29.760 called they will be low and review right
19:31.600 but sometime in this context is that the
19:33.200 ea is part of the it project team and ea
19:36.480 instead of helping actually is blocking
19:38.480 the project in many cases
19:40.400 based on what i come across and work
19:42.480 with the quite number of banks so so
19:44.320 it's particularly it's not a smooth
19:46.000 smooth relationship right so if
19:48.080 if the id team have a choice they said
19:49.919 they want to get it get rid of the itch
19:52.400 and they want to get rid of the ea team
19:54.559 because 18 doesn't help right
19:56.559 then in terms of the so-called uh any
19:58.559 changes again back to the to the ea team
20:01.120 being called in and then see whether you
20:02.480 want to approve or don't approve right
20:04.080 so these are the typical uh setup in the
20:06.720 many of the fsi that i come across yeah
20:10.480 so by right
20:12.080 this uh the just now the two setup is
20:13.840 because you have the the ea is part of
20:16.799 the project management the ea is part of
20:18.880 the pmo right it's not really quite
20:21.360 independent
20:22.559 that actually all the input needs to be
20:24.880 done by the architecture team i mean in
20:26.640 terms of validation business alignment
20:28.720 strategy validation and etc
20:31.600 so where the ea actually should be it
20:33.919 should be before the project management
20:35.919 right because people say oh i need to
20:37.919 set up ea
20:39.120 ea to me or to us is that actually is
20:41.440 the pmo minus one so it's basically it's
20:44.159 a program uh management office minus one
20:47.280 where uh basically you understand you
20:49.600 work closely with the key stakeholders
20:51.360 to discover their efficient their
20:53.280 strategy their mission et cetera
20:55.840 and of course the bottom part is where
20:57.280 you need to have the right uh
20:59.120 digital ea repository as a single source
200.880 of truth for all team from ea oh pmo to
204.000 ipsm otherwise they will be like a
206.480 chinese whisper you know the game
207.760 chinese visible they've got ten people
209.840 so you whisper one one statement by the
212.480 time
213.520 person one two person ten the person can
215.360 say something different that's what
217.039 happened in many of the it project if
219.440 you don't have a proper single source of
221.520 truth
222.480 so the top layer is where you connect
224.640 between business technology strategy uh
226.799 together
229.120 so this is what it should be right so if
231.000 No text
231.520 you understand where the es would
233.039 function so typically the the eao is
236.000 where uh you also involved in the ear
238.320 project initiation this is where you
240.640 start discovering or
242.720 understand what are the key standards
244.320 concerns right we
246.000 we model the driver and the strategy
248.320 then after that we go into the analysis
250.000 and design so we understand the impact
252.159 bring to the business to the data
253.919 application and technology
255.679 okay then after that we developed a
257.679 solution
258.480 so solution basically is the high level
22:00.480 solutioning whereby we understand that
22:02.880 certain technology technology is
22:04.480 required to be procured right so we need
22:07.039 to plug into the particular technology
22:08.880 after the architecture is done yeah so
22:10.880 this typically done by the
22:13.200 enterprise architecture office then from
22:15.039 there of course we can hand over to the
22:17.760 pmo okay so pmo we prioritize all the
22:20.559 projects
22:21.440 so pmo said okay this is the request or
22:23.440 so called the output from the enterprise
22:25.200 team they got 20 projects but pmo will
22:28.159 prioritize based on the budget and also
22:30.000 priority of the uh
22:33.280 the need of the
22:35.039 organization in terms of which projects
22:36.799 should go fast
22:38.000 then from there we execute the
22:39.840 implementation that's where the internal
22:41.679 architecture actually playing a
22:44.240 governance right because
22:46.320 architecture now is they know what they
22:48.480 have developed they want to see the real
22:50.480 execution it's like the construction the
22:52.480 construction is after they draw uh
22:54.559 architect architecture they will go on
22:56.799 site to periodically uh survey or
23:00.400 or ensure its conformance right then one
23:02.960 day one is done and go live then they go
23:04.799 change management so this management
23:06.240 there will be all the activity required
23:08.720 to um
23:11.120 implement or adapt to the changes this
23:13.200 way the enterprise architectural office
23:15.039 as well work closely with the itsm team
23:17.440 right so typically now pmo and atm
23:20.000 they've got their ops their ops to
23:21.679 combine them then they look at the gap
23:23.760 alignment right so if they is there any
23:25.919 architecture need to be changed so this
23:27.679 also called the the good model moving
23:30.400 forwards yeah instead of you are doing a
23:32.480 governance or solutioning part
23:35.120 and in terms of the repository itself so
23:36.960 we need to set up properly so they got
23:37.000 No text
23:38.640 uh of course we need to embed our meta
23:40.480 model the methodology or the template
23:43.520 references like like beyond uh
23:47.039 uh ea framework and etc
23:49.520 and of course how the domain itself
23:51.360 being organized right business data
23:53.279 application technology as well as the
23:54.720 whole life cycle
23:56.000 so because architecture is always like
23:57.679 in the toggle is the like a wheels so
24:00.240 you are rotating right so you go to
24:01.760 transition one transition to transition
24:03.440 three and how you can also call preserve
24:07.039 the previous transition in the
24:08.799 repository okay so this is something
24:10.480 very very important
24:12.880 and of course not not to forget about
24:14.799 maturity so maturity also are very very
24:17.000 No text
24:17.840 critical so we need to know about where
24:20.080 we are okay so typically in the on in
24:22.159 the on when an organization just started
24:24.720 the digital ea uh journey so typically
24:27.840 they are there their maturity is around
24:31.039 2.0 right so basically maybe this year
24:33.279 in the middle of the year right they
24:34.559 started they measured their maturity so
24:36.559 2.0 then after that of course uh next
24:39.520 year right next year and also the year
24:41.919 after we are targeting about 2.5 right
24:44.159 because we are maturing in terms of our
24:46.559 practice right in the context of the
24:48.640 maturity they call it uh the developing
24:51.279 then after that of course we're talking
24:52.799 about define defined mean we are
24:54.960 achieving at the level three right so
24:57.200 when you go in the defined states
24:58.559 basically you will have the full
24:59.760 integration with your itt right with
25:01.679 your software development lifecycle team
25:03.679 and you can onboard your business team
25:05.279 together so your single source of
25:07.279 through should be able to connect from
25:08.559 your archimedes to the bpmn and uml
25:11.039 then of course you want to achieve
25:12.880 next level with this minutes right but
25:15.200 of course menace is level five but
25:16.720 reality is that 3.5 is already highly
25:19.279 efficient we are talking now about
25:21.279 efficient enterprise architecture
25:23.120 because you don't want to go uh
25:25.919 i mean maintaining 3.5 is already good
25:28.320 because
25:29.360 i will have done a lot of the maturity
25:31.679 assessment and not many organizations
25:33.520 can reach can reach 3.5
25:35.600 it's a lot a lot of the effort and
25:37.440 investment required
25:38.960 then of course if you can if you are the
25:41.520 next uh you know five six years when you
25:44.159 are everyone uh become a ea as a culture
25:47.039 maybe you maintain you can maintain at
25:49.200 the 4.0 yeah so this is something um
25:52.559 the journey like
25:54.640 and of course with that what we are
25:56.240 trying to do is that many organizations
25:58.080 today many financial services that are
25:59.000 No text
25:59.919 focusing a lot ear focusing on the
26:01.520 solution and some of the manual year
26:03.679 process because use excel spreadsheet
26:05.679 and even the good repository but it's
26:07.039 not really configured correctly then of
26:09.120 course fragmented architecture practice
26:10.880 on the reactive and unmanaged
26:12.480 architecture independent architecture
26:15.279 multiple version multiple projects
26:17.039 different project or different version
26:18.320 of architecture so what it should be is
26:20.320 that we need instead of solution focus
26:22.480 we need to be focused on architecture
26:24.240 right so we need to be consolidated all
26:26.640 the effort into a single initiative
26:29.520 then of course talking about manual year
26:31.120 process this way we need to automate all
26:33.600 the our year process right not only
26:36.159 the business process needs to be
26:37.440 automated but ea process also need to be
26:39.200 automated because we are living in the
26:40.480 digital era today
26:41.919 of course from the fragmented
26:42.960 architecture practice we can unify and
26:44.799 we use perpetual architecture practice
26:47.039 right so we are nimble and we are
26:49.440 adaptable so we are we have the meta
26:51.600 model so certain thing that we know that
26:53.520 certain metamodels are mandatory
26:55.200 certainly optional and we know exactly
26:57.039 where to apply the optional part
26:59.919 then the next one of course um unmanned
27:02.000 architecture said we can use uh reusable
27:04.480 and maintenance architecture that's why
27:05.760 we need to have a
27:07.279 lifecycle itself we need to know what we
27:09.520 have done in the earlier uh our journey
27:12.400 and how we can reuse them so basically
27:14.480 don't need to reinvent the wheel all the
27:15.919 time
27:17.200 and of course in terms of independent
27:18.399 architecture architecture model we can
27:19.760 do end to end right integrated model so
27:22.559 we can we can have a digital map i think
27:24.720 you can look at my earlier presentation
27:26.960 i think i've talked a lot on this right
27:28.559 about how you get the so-called
27:30.080 end-to-end architecture model
27:33.200 so with that i think this is my last
27:35.039 slide right about the uh good news for
27:37.840 the fsi only in singapore and also in
27:41.279 malaysia right so in singapore if you
27:43.679 are working in the financial services or
27:45.440 if you are individual right if you're a
27:47.679 singaporean or
27:49.230 [Music]
27:50.399 a papaya resident you can apply for the
27:53.520 ibf grant okay the grant is super gener
27:56.240 generous
27:57.360 is 90 and you can also claim the skill
28:00.720 future 10 percent so basically is free
28:02.240 of charge okay in malaysia also got a
28:05.760 claimable under hazard pajama and
28:09.919 yeah so
28:11.039 pretty much there but hong kong also
28:13.279 have a grant but indonesia another
28:15.360 country i'm not so sure there isn't much
28:17.360 grant from the government but singapore
28:19.760 in
28:20.799 malaysia and hong kong have a government
28:23.200 grant available to all the architecture
28:25.200 courses

00.000 No text
06.580 thanks for joining me the next 45 minutes to talk a little bit about enterprise architecture and the
12.950 role it plays in large organizations as you can see from the slides I now work
19.550 for Google as a technical director and what we call the office of the CTO so my
24.770 job is largely to work with with large organizations at the CIO or CTO level or
31.189 Enterprise Architect level and help them draw the right frame around cloud adoptions which includes architectural
38.540 changes organizational changes cultural changes so a lot of the things I'm gonna talk about our based on those
45.019 conversations as well as my experience at Allianz before I read you on Google I
50.329 worked five years at Allianz a very large insurance company and I was the chief architect there and I actually
56.179 originally joined as head of enterprise architecture and when I did so I didn't really even know what enterprise
002.300 architecture is or what a head of enterprise architecture does but over the years I really got a very sort of
011.060 appreciation of what architecture is really meant to be doing and also find a
016.640 lot of ways in which it doesn't quite do what is meant to be doing and let me start with this part right when we talk
022.730 about enterprise architecture right there's two key problems we see we tend
028.490 to see all right the first problem I show the first problem is the clicker is on the wrong window I'll fix that
036.760 ah there we go the first problem we see is usually the enterprise architects are seen as the people who live high up and
037.000 No text
043.300 in the in the ivory tower right they just draw pictures they talk about stuff right but they don't actually solve the
050.590 real problems where they leave this to the other folks and the reason for that is is often that the organization's
057.610 allow people to do this and at the end of the day it is much easier to draw
02:03.220 pictures than to get actually software running so if your organization allows somebody to call that a success people
02:10.840 will always do that right unfortunately that doesn't really bring the value to
02:16.030 the organization and that's why I don't really count this as enterprise architecture basically I count this as a
02:22.510 hiding place for people are no longer technical and can no longer deliver software so this is not what it's meant
02:27.790 to be problem number two is when people talk about you know the Enterprise Architect they generally think of this
02:28.000 No text
02:34.690 guy Ryan is like the architect from the matrix you know some wise wise man right
02:40.480 who just knows everything and decides everything and of course that model is equally broken because nobody is now
02:48.070 smart enough to know everything and make all the decisions and in fact in the movie it's not a person it's a computer
02:54.459 program right so if you want to play the analogy right this is not a human being but again there's a reason this happens
03:02.110 because for many folks in the organization it's actually convenient to
03:07.269 find somebody who makes all the important decisions because you know making those big decisions isn't an easy
03:14.080 task so invariably something will go wrong you will make a wrong decision now if you have somebody else who makes all
03:20.650 these important decisions it's very convenient because it's not your problem it's the other person's problem and
03:26.019 again this is not what our enterprise architecture is meant to be at all so let's talk a little bit about what I
03:32.050 think the role of enterprise architecture is and then I'll also talk a little bit about what is a good way to
03:38.260 think like an enterprise architect right so how do you how do you actually do the job so the most important thing is I
03:42.000 No text
03:44.920 believe just to understand how Enterprise Architect fits within IT architecture most of the
03:50.200 time when you meet an architect in an event like this or an organization they will be an IT architect a software
03:55.960 architect infrastructure architect cloud architect right you will have those kind of things and you kind of curious that
04:03.370 on the business side you have fewer folks being called architect which
04:08.380 should make you slightly suspicious because the large part of ite is to support the business right so you wonder
04:14.770 where the people who actually are key take the business because what that looks like really drives what the IT
04:20.860 looks like to a large extent and you will find that recently there's a bit more of a movement called business
04:26.950 architecture that formalizes that similarly to IT architecture but largely
04:32.140 the business architects will be the business leaders they will be chief operating officers vice president's
04:38.890 department heads they usually don't have the title architect but if you see in
04:44.050 what they do and how they think about their work like the designing business units and divisions and product plans
04:50.290 etc they actually very much behave like architects so in the end they are the
04:55.990 architects of the business now the true need to have a connection and that is
05:01.630 the key role of the enterprise architecture right to make sure that the IT architecture matches the business
05:07.990 architecture because if that is out of whack for some reason all the fancy stuff we do nighty is pointless
05:14.800 right then it becomes Hobby because we're doing stuff right we're building fancy docker container kubernetes
05:20.620 whatever stuff right if it doesn't match what the business actually needs that is about the worst case scenario you can
05:26.830 have so there's a corollary to this and that means you know if Enterprise Architecture is sort of the connecting
05:32.530 element between the business and IT architecture you will quickly realize that the more
05:38.490 these two are apart the more enterprise architecture you will need and this is
05:43.980 one of the reasons that in digital companies where like inside Google you
05:49.080 will find relatively little enterprise architecture that doesn't mean they don't do enterprise architecture but it
05:56.070 means that business and IT are very closely interlinked that they don't need this thing that they don't need two
06:02.040 crutches if you will right they don't need the enterprise architecture as a helper they fulfill the enterprise
06:07.950 architecture function what is neat what needs to be done without having a
06:13.470 separate department for it then in a vast majority of large traditional organizations that is not yet the case
06:19.890 right they have separate IT divisions they have shared IT service providers all these kind of things so the two are
06:25.680 a little bit further apart and that means enterprise architecture plays a critically important role
06:31.760 now the isn't easy is easy sort of three-step process how enterprise architecture works right there's no
06:32.000 No text
06:37.940 1-2-3 framework unfortunately but I think what can help to really appreciate
06:43.650 and understand enterprise architecture is to look at what I call the enterprise architecture value chain right you're
06:50.880 working for a business so I need to create value if you're creating value this value doesn't come yeah out of the
06:57.780 blue sky that value is created somehow that's what's the value chain right so
07:03.180 just like the business has a value chain where they buy raw materials and then their simple product they ship product
07:08.760 right retail they have a value chain how would they provide value to the end user and device architecture also has a value
07:15.300 chain and what we'll do in the first part of my talk will will run through this value chain now the other thing
07:21.330 that's important here the reason it's called a chain is because a chain is made out of those links and that has the
07:28.530 additional property that if one link is broken the chain is broken so that means
07:34.050 if as an Enterprise Architect you you skip or miss somehow one of these items
07:39.810 the value chain is not there you're not providing value right you can understand the business
07:45.100 energy better than the CEO but you're not delivering the value because you're not making it to the end the other part
07:52.390 that will find this these steps are not rocket science right and if you can I have an opener and you can kind of have
07:58.060 a feel what this is so the steps are not somehow black magic but doing this in
08:03.880 the complexity and scope of a larger organization is actually quite difficult so we will find that is is to a large
08:10.300 extent the the challenge of enterprise architecture so let's start at the top and we'll run down the enterprise
08:12.000 No text
08:18.040 architecture value chain extremely less it sounds the first thing you need to do is you need to understand the business
08:23.670 and the business in this in this context has really two parts right there is what
08:29.110 the business does in the market right what does it sell and then there's also the business as an organization right
08:35.200 how is the business structure so I worked five years for insurance company and many people think insurance is
08:40.809 relatively boring right is some in Germany Bahamas off this image of the middle-aged guy in a suit and a little
08:46.840 suitcase who comes to the house and sells you some car insurance or life insurance kind of very very boring and
08:53.320 he does this for like 30 years and it never changes it is actually not quite true in a Leonsis case it's a very large
09:00.160 global insurance company so you can buy travel insurance when you buy like your airline ticket and it has so the next
09:07.090 pop out and says oh oh do you also want to be insured for five more dollars they do that hope they also insure the
09:13.960 aircraft you're gonna fly in and the oil drilling platform that pumps the oil that ultimately produces the kerosene
09:20.260 and probably they insure the refinery in between as well that makes the kerosene for the aircraft you're gonna go into so
09:26.410 if you see something bad happening on the news you know like some large-scale large insurance companies like aliens
09:32.800 are involved right and these are all real examples right from the Hindenburg on this is all
09:37.930 claims for Allianz insurance right a fairly old organization but that also means that sort of just paying out a
09:44.770 claim isn't the key role of an insurance company at this scale right if something like this happens they need crisis
09:51.760 management right people can have lead to protect their brand or they need to rescue people right or they need to
09:57.160 restore operations so the business is often much more interesting that it
10:02.230 seems right it's really forced arrogance if we think all our IT is too interesting because we have all the cool
10:08.260 docker kubernetes tends to flow a I quantum computing stuff and the business or the selling is like insurance
10:13.810 policies that is actually very very dangerous attitude a business generally once you look at this in is interesting
10:20.320 so that's kind of seeing what the business does and of course the next thing that's very important to understand this where do they make the
10:26.980 money and the money can mean revenue but revenue doesn't mean margin right where do they have growth areas where do they
10:33.340 expand how they maybe gonna sell off some units are they're acquiring a lot of new companies right you might think
10:39.760 hey I'm just an IT architect right why do I have to deal with this that's the CEOs problem but as you can quickly see
10:46.120 all this have an impact on the IT architecture right if you do a lot of acquisitions you need a lot of
10:51.670 integration right things like that the translation is much more a pair I'm a much more real than its apparent so I
10:58.480 did this for example on the ancestry and once I travel through Asia and understood what is actually going on
103.610 Asia for Leonce is largely a life insurance market Malaysia is the most biggest property in casual market you
109.850 know they sold their business in Korea they started business in Hong Kong right you start to get a feel for how the
116.570 dynamic of this business works and is asset the second part of this is you also understand
118.000 No text
123.300 okay I'll just keep going with us the screen there we also understand how the
128.550 organization is structured right most organizations have to deal with different dimensions right
133.800 they have different geographies they have different product lines they have different functions right it could be in Asia doing life insurance and being in
141.480 sales or you could be in Europe doing Property and Casualty and working in claims so let's business architecture right
148.079 they have three different dimensions somehow they need to make an organization out of this so usually they are organized by country and then by
154.470 product and then by function right this is all quite interesting to know because if you as an enterprise architect want
12:02.480 to really make the connection between the business architecture on the IT architecture this is the business architecture to large extent so you need
12:09.290 to understand that who are the right people and how is the business as an organization structured to work the
12:17.000 markets that they're in the ecology base you reverse engineering the organization and generally as architects you're
12:22.910 pretty good at this right we can do stuff like this we can understand the structure of systems in this case it's
12:28.490 just not a technical system it's an organizational system so it might seem very far away from our daily job but
12:32.000 No text
12:35.060 extra your brain is actually pretty well equipped to to follow this kind of logic and the last important thing you need to
12:42.440 do at the very top of the value chain is you need to understand how will the IT is embedded into the rest of the
12:48.860 organization and usually the IT ends at the CIO right so it's a chief information officer right that's the
12:56.660 person he or she who has all the IT budget and most people in IT will ultimately report to a CIO to achieve
13:03.110 information officer right that is actually pretty tough job so a lot of people joke that CI o stands for career
13:09.260 is over I had that's one of the bad jokes because yeah it's it's really a tough job especially these days you need
13:16.579 to keep the cost down you need to innovate right you need to have cloud staff I mean you know cyber security can
13:22.070 make you instantly unemployed right usually CIO takes the hit so interesting job so what's important
13:29.140 is how just the business look at this CIO and his or her organization what do they expect and
13:34.860 traditionally the IT and most organizations grew large because it automated what the business did it was a
13:42.220 cost saver right I do things by manually today and that cost a lot of money because it's labor-intensive if I have a
13:48.670 computer I can do this on the screen I can automate this cost me less money it's a good thing and that's basic for
13:54.400 about half a century how IG grew as big as it is today the catch is it's very much cost driven
14:00.550 right it's all about cost reduction and we talked about reverse engineering the organization so one way to get a hint
14:07.930 that your organization believes I t's main purpose is to reduce cost is if the
14:14.080 CIO reports to the chief financial officer CFO chief financial officer is
14:19.720 the person who writes the checks right so if it's all about money spent reducing money spent that's where the
14:24.940 reporting line is and that's very important because let's say as an architect you come out with a fantastic
14:31.000 hybrid cloud strategy right like and I always use docker kubernetes as an example right it's all this hybrid cloud
14:37.840 containers container orchestration you can move in and out you have a CI ACD pipeline right you can push software
14:43.900 anytime see I always not gonna be interested because his boss it's not gonna be interested or her boss right
14:49.450 because it's all about cost reduction and all you just talked about is about gaining speed and flexibility right you
14:56.500 sold speed and flexibility to somebody who only cares about cost and that sale is not gonna go through and this usually
15:03.070 results in IT people being frustrated saying nobody wants to fund my project these people are stupid they don't
15:08.830 understand my containers are so important for us right but in the end you're just totally communicating at the
15:15.340 wrong line so these things are important and you will see that a lot of organizations are changing these
15:21.790 reporting lines as their mindset is changing so a lot of organizations moving the CIO reporting lines over to
15:28.720 the chief operating officer and that's a big step ahead because now they're talking about return on
15:34.750 investment they're willing to put money in if they get more money out so at least money flows and the left side no
15:40.930 money flows in the first place at least here money flows if something comes back here you can start arguing but generally
15:47.770 they're driven by optimizations right economies of scale these are large companies they do something in IT and
15:53.830 then they get the return of investment because they roll this out across the whole organization so this is all about
16:00.000 harmonization standardization right these are the people we're like you know
16:05.110 we try to get everything on the same Linux version right very important stuff but usually not the stuff that excites
16:11.830 us all as much as architects but as Enterprise Architecture studies be done where it gets really interesting as you
16:18.370 move further to the right this is where people see that IT is not a support function but IT is really partner of the
16:25.240 business right I often say the compact disc wasn't an end-user requirement right this was technology driving a late
16:32.830 and need for music on demand and the tapes couldn't really do that and the CD could do that this was technology
16:38.770 enablement that unlocked a latent need it wasn't the user saying oh I need a spinning thing with little holes in it
16:45.550 that a laser can read right this is not the users game and this also can easily tell you why the city went away so
16:52.090 quickly because the need for instant access to music just flipped to streaming right it solved the same need boom end of CD right very quickly so
16:59.500 this is where it's quite interesting now what I haven't talked about is in these kind of models there is a logical
17:06.970 conclusion about what you should do with the IT if it's a pure cost you should
17:12.849 outsource it because somebody can do it more cheaply than you can right and many of us don't like that as much
17:18.939 but it's the logical thing to do right if you're looking to unlock business value if you're trying to really make IT
17:25.809 a part of the business it is actually the opposite right because the driver is no longer cost the drivers agility you
17:33.130 know and I remind people agility is the ability to steer right agility is being able to maneuver and if your ideas
17:39.700 in-house you don't have contracts in the way you have shorter communication powers right you have shared goals it is
17:46.630 easier to get into this agile model so it's exactly the opposite and you can
17:52.090 see from organizations right organizations that are making a big outsourcing push still they probably
17:58.450 still in the model on the left hand side versus organizations that bring the IT back in they probably move further to
18:04.269 the right-hand side and what you'll find is that in addition to the CIO or in a
18:09.880 reporting line you usually have a CDO as chief digital officer right those people have understood that the digital world
18:16.090 has different rules of the game and ultimately the CIO should just a report to the CEO the CIO all of the IT should
18:23.200 be equally important to all the other functions like finance and operations and marketing and sales right this
18:28.389 should all be equally important and that is ultimately what you see we're really I T equals business guide the
18:34.539 distinction no longer exists and I call this the economies of speed people have
18:39.580 realized that in the digital world it's not about how big you are but about how fast you are right and they work very
18:45.000 No text
18:45.250 differently in the IT so not quite a lot of what to do up there to understand the
18:50.919 business strategy oh the business environment now you'd need to translate that business strategy into an IT
18:56.860 strategy and the key thing I remind folks off that the most important thing about a strategy is it's not reality
19:03.090 it's a direction you want to go so I once had a IT strategy where I said I am
19:08.919 gonna package my applications in containers and sometimes I saw my application can be containerized that
19:15.250 does not invalidate the strategy right it's a direction of vision it's a goal you drive towards it's not something
19:22.269 that's supposed to be 100% reality today and immediately the other important part and there's
19:28.240 some very smart people who who coined that that quote which is strategy is what you're not doing
19:34.120 faster better cheaper wishful thinking that is not a strategy right strategy is
19:39.430 focused and focused includes excluding stuff alright and the last one that
19:44.830 happens in large enterprises they're very much influenced by the vendors
19:50.290 right because large enterprises are generally by overbuilt type organization that's a good thing right why should you
19:56.230 buy software that you can buy because ultimately you should build the stuff that differentiates them in the market
20:01.690 and you shouldn't build your own persistence for him port right so you buy this kind of stuff and you buy the server but what can easily happen is
20:08.230 that sort of the product vendors roadmap starts acting as a proxy to your IT
20:13.480 strategy and that is very dangerous because that is the strategy for the vendor not for your business right and
20:20.320 they might have good things in mind but still they don't know what's best for you and they have a very specific view on
20:27.250 your business from the product that they sell they don't have the complete view and that's what you need to do is you
20:33.730 need to have a complete strategy know where you driving know what's important to you
20:39.010 maybe automation is important right so you go to the vendor who comes and says well how do you install their software
20:44.980 and if it's anything more than a push of a button and something fully automated you say sorry guys doesn't match my
20:50.110 strategy right and maybe the vendor can fix it right but those are the kind of conversations you want to have in the
20:55.810 vendor you want to know what's important to you does it run in the cloud can it go in a container does it run fully
201.690 automated right and then you you see whether the vendors product matches that doing it the other way around is
207.000 No text
208.380 extremely dangerous so the very first book that there was around about n device architectures called enterprise
214.920 architecture strategy as so often with the first book it's an
220.320 important book but it's not always the best book right because you know it's very the very beginning of the
225.480 collective understanding so I would say it's fair to say that this book has one most important diagram and it's this new
232.350 2x2 matrix the good news with two-by-two matrices is that management has been
237.870 here sufficiently inundated with two-by-two matrices by McKinsey & Co so they always understand everything that's
243.570 on a two-by-two matrix sorry if you're trying to make something easy to understand this is a good strategy
248.960 this one does require some explanation though so what's going on here there's two x's on this matrix and it
256.650 shows how much the business processes are standardized versus how much they
22:01.900 integrated and at the bottom left you will find interesting businesses that are neither standardized nor integrated
22:08.890 now this could be like Siemens or GE or some companies that make everything under the planet right from a locomotive
22:14.860 to a power station to a train to a refrigerator I mean it's basically they make everything it's not standardized
22:21.130 and it's not integrated on the bottom right hand side you will and and let me see you can actually then see what you
22:26.920 do if they really that the worse the best you can do is basically try to come get some economies of scale by at least
22:34.120 getting them on the same infrastructure right but they won't have the same applications because they do so many
22:39.310 diverse things right so all you can do is basic and I give them Lin of service right or something like that if you're
22:45.310 in a replication environment right this is like a franchise you have McDonald's right every business is the same right
22:52.180 so you can give them a whole application suite in in modern software architecture terms there would be software as a
22:58.420 service right you can make this as a SAS model right all the new McDonald's branch has to do is log on to your cloud
23:03.820 and boom they have all the Sales inventory payment everything they need it could be easily done because it's
23:10.240 highly replicated every mcdonald's is like the next mcdonald's that is the strength of the franchise model right
23:16.100 on the other hand one McDonald says very little to do with another McDonald's right they operate very independently
23:22.160 the only thing that rolls up in the end is the financials so here you know
23:27.170 common applications standardizations on the application is interesting but integration is less valuable versus you
23:34.100 have a business that is diverse but highly integrated then integration and
23:39.410 data standardization data warehouse data lakes all these kind of things are much more valuable and those are examples
23:46.430 where you can see that the nature of the business we call this the operating model of the business right how would
23:53.270 that make certain IT strategies more valuable or less valuable alright if you're highly integrated stuff around
23:59.240 data Enterprise Service bus integration data warehouse will have a high value it will have less value for a McDonald's
24:06.680 type operation there you want to make sure you have the application replication right and there's companies
24:12.140 that that have the combination of two so that's the critical translation step between business strategy and IT
24:16.000 No text
24:19.970 strategy third one was any transparency right and it sounds much more trivial
24:25.400 than it actually is because if you don't have transparency you you can't do anything yeah you can't really steal the
24:31.190 organization right unfortunately usually reality looks like this and I always
24:36.500 joke that this is a fantastic architecture because this is extremely
24:42.470 scalable architecture if you haven't thought about it and the simple reason why it's so scalable is I mean to me
24:48.380 it's blatantly obvious the reason it's so scalable is because look the database is down here and nothing connects to it
24:54.950 right so it must be 100% stateless rain is great
25:00.750 scalable joke aside creating transparency in a large organization is a huge undertaking right and you need
25:08.370 will come to this you need to also not just document reality but you need to find a model to really represent reality
25:14.460 that allows you to reason about it that allows you to chart a road map alright
25:17.000 No text
25:19.620 and that is the next step in the value chain right so we have the business strategy IT strategy we have reality and
25:25.170 you will always find a gap you never where you want to be so now you make a road map um I wasn't confident Australia
25:31.650 when somebody said very nicely he said management are suckers for plans they
25:37.140 love a plan right as an architect we will always like to show the target picture and often to management that's
25:43.140 confusing right it's like the taco kubernetes whatever right so they're like what is this off but management
25:49.650 loves the roadmap management laugh so first you do this you make it nice and
25:54.780 easy so this is a real example right what does one of these roadmaps look like yeah one of the biggest problems
26:00.210 you know we have in this enterprises that all the applications are completely separate they're not well integrated
26:06.270 there's silos and they use a tiny bit of common infrastructure ultimately they all run on on an x86 server if you're
26:12.960 lucky right but it's a huge duplication right data silos no integration they all
26:18.660 have their own tool chain their own testing framework they don't run time automation their own deployment automation right all that is duplicated
26:24.510 so what do we need to do we need to solve two problems we need to get some sort of API or some sort of integration
26:30.930 layer on these things and we need to grow a common platform out of a bottom an application having its own tool chain
26:37.830 its own testing and deployment framework probably doesn't sell your business a single dollar right so that is non
26:44.940 differentiating that stuff you should harmonize right because it's non differentiating and once you have done that you can also
26:52.530 start breaking down these applications into smaller services because if you don't have a really well greased
26:58.890 harmonized runtime it's going to be very difficult to do this with smaller services right you can sort of get away
27:05.370 with it if you have three huge applications that all have their own tool chain and runtime and automation and monitoring but you live
27:12.269 100 services you won't be able to deal with that right so this is a classic sorta IT roadmap we grow the common
27:18.539 platform let me break down into smaller services you know micro services if you wish and you can see here the next thing you do
27:25.379 is also because you have this common runtime you abstracted the applications and services away from the
27:31.709 infrastructure so now you gain some flexibility to move things from on-premise into the cloud classic IT
27:38.339 strategy right translate it into a roadmap that is relatively management
27:45.509 compatible right upper management will understand this but the next thing you need to do so people buy into your
27:51.509 roadmap so now you need a lever right you need to somehow make sure that the stuff that you have actually gets onto
27:58.289 this this roadmap right I often say an architect is more like a gardener right
28:03.869 the weeds grow or the plants grow by themselves and the weeds grow the fastest right and idea is the same right
28:09.719 the weeds grow everywhere so you need to start pruning and here's another real example where we try to make very clear
28:16.679 and very simple what is the IT strategy what is the roadmap and where do be harmonized right and in this case the
28:23.820 left-hand side was a big problem for this arty because the applications were
28:29.070 relatively rigid so they were prescriptive prescriptive at the top where the business actually wanted some
28:35.940 flexibility right the business might have a great idea or this market might be different than this market or this
28:40.979 product different in this product so the implications couldn't deliver the flexibility that the business needed but
28:48.059 at the same time at the bottom they had a huge diversity right then every possible hardware and software mainframe
28:53.639 iix your Linux windows x86 I mean everything you can imagine they have right so it's a worst case scenario
29:00.180 because you have a lot of diversity that you pay for at the infrastructure level which is not providing a differentiator
29:07.740 for your business right an insurance company has not sold a single policy because it's on x86 processors versus
29:14.160 other ones right they sell insurance policy because they have systems that support the business and engage the
29:20.130 customer so a key part of the harmonization strategy was harmonized at the bottom right get this diversity out
29:26.640 of the infrastructure get things on linux get in and dokkum container automate the deployment and run time and
29:32.070 really shrink that and you see the platform again there by James Lewis just gave a very nice talk about the role
29:38.100 that platforms play and then on top you don't want to harmonize I do wanna Li
29:43.140 give the business the ability to experiment flexibility right it would be foolish to harmonize too strictly there
29:49.140 because that's what drives the business so it's very important in this harmonization on governance that you
29:55.410 understand where you want to tighten the screw and where you maybe intentionally want to loosen the screw right and those
30:02.100 are some of the important considerations of an enterprise architecture you will have people running around so go we need
30:07.980 to harmonize everything right they they call the word somewhere and say harmonizing is good it saves money but
30:13.410 then harmonizing can also kill your business already if you harmonize the wrong things now this all sounds
30:16.000 No text
30:19.040 fantastically easy right but the reality is you know you have a nice plan but the
30:24.720 reality looks a lot different than your plan right and this little you can do about it I often joke that in Germany
30:31.770 right I work for a large German company when the reality doesn't match your plan you blame the reality because your plan
30:38.700 you've worked so hard your plan must be good right so if it's not working something is wrong in reality sadly it's
30:44.850 hard to argue with reality a little bit reality can be a bit stubborn on this right so what do you need to do again no
30:52.440 magic recipe is you need to cost correct and the important thing is when you in course correct two things you need right
30:59.570 you need agility right you need an ability to steer but you also need a clear target right because if you keep
305.720 cost correct and you don't have a compass or target you just keep going in circles right so it sounds nice to
310.880 course-correct but he can only do this if you have a clear direction that that you're going into and a lot of stuff
316.700 that you'll find the stuff that you won't like but what you're gonna do right is better to find out that not to
322.640 find out and that brings us to the end of the valley change at the very last one and that's an important one is
327.000 No text
328.000 enterprise architecture is not just about doing architecture it is also about growing the awareness and the
334.880 skill in the organization for architecture you will never have enough
339.890 people to work with you won't have the skill set you know that you can communicate in a high bandwidth model
345.740 right so there's a there's a true motivation to just do this but on the
351.170 other hand this is also the right thing to do if you made it to become an enterprise architect right your role is
357.620 also to help other people make that journey right it's not the game of like who gets to the top first but it's the
32:03.860 game whoever gets to the top helps lift the other people up alright and that is the coaching and the mentoring part and
32:11.030 that's important not to forget because that's what in the end fuels the cycle right you will need other architects to
32:17.179 help you you will need more understanding a broader support so if you don't do this you will lose your
32:22.580 basis right Linda rising also earlier made this very clear right you think like oh I have all the great ideas I
32:28.250 don't need anybody's help right that is the quickest path right right into the dead end so that's the value chain so
32:36.050 now let's talk about what goes on in the head of an Enterprise Architect and we'll find that it's three key things
32:43.070 and I enter as architect needs to do to to solve these kind of problems to make
32:48.110 this value chain work but before they do this I want to share one of my favorite definitions of architecture and that is
32:51.000 No text
32:55.940 when I talk about it's very simple you know so now everybody knows how architecture works this is actually the
33:03.020 black Scholes formula those guys got a Nobel Prize for this right so pretty clever guys when you talk to the
33:09.029 business and you're trying to explain what architecture does most business people actually understand this stuff
33:14.490 especially the financial organization you tell them I sell options right
33:19.799 what does architecture do architecture gives you flexibility architecture gives you the ability to make changes in the
33:26.309 future right those are options am I gonna move to the cloud or am I not gonna move to the cloud do I want to
33:32.340 have this option or do I not need this option do I need to be able to dynamically scale my application I can
33:39.419 buy this option this option is called stateless architecture horizontally scaling architecture the option is not
33:45.899 free just like in a financial market so what this formula does it calculates the value of an object so options are not
33:52.169 free because it lets you buy flexibility into the in the future and that has that
33:57.690 has a value right because I don't know yet which way it's gonna go so buying myself the ability to go left or right
34:04.320 clearly has value right you can draw the decision trees and do the math very easily so that's what architecture does
34:11.579 and the key conversation between architecture and the business is here's the list of options that I think you
34:17.010 might find useful let's talk about which options are worth buying and there's a small follow up to this and this is
34:23.579 actually buried in this interesting formula is that in a volatile environment the value of the option
34:30.060 increases all right you can easily imagine if you know exactly what's gonna happen if you build an application for
34:35.969 10 users and it will always be 10 users the option to scale dynamically isn't that valuable but if you're building an
34:42.659 internet scale application right but you could have 10 users a day and 10 million users tomorrow the option is highly
34:48.179 valuable so now we live in a very volatile world like so many changes going on in the business environment in
34:53.969 the technical environment that the value of these options goes up so this is a
34:59.190 very nice pitch you're most welcome to borrow to your business that's why they should invest more money in architecture
35:05.010 because tell you they get from the option that you as an architect are selling is
35:10.640 increasing my business people will understand that logic so you're welcome to borrow that model three things
35:15.000 No text
35:17.420 architects do connections so there's one ugly truth in architecture that is no
35:22.819 one actually cares about the architecture and certainly this message comes straight from me you know former chief architect it's kind of you might
35:29.720 say oh well that's a little bit depressing all right nobody cares about the architecture because the customers don't see you
35:35.299 architecture your customers see how will the system's behave like today are they
35:37.000 No text
35:41.599 are they performant do they run 24/7 right are they broken all the time are they able to accommodate rapid changes
35:48.529 now if you look at the system right left and right has the same pieces right ABCD
35:54.279 but what's the difference the difference is they put together differently the connections are different and yeah if I
36:02.000 ask any architect do these two systems have different properties that will give me a list of like 10 things immediately right and the left it's easier to
36:08.299 replace something but latency might be longer and if one component fails on the left hand side everything falls apart
36:13.940 versus the right hand side has shorter paths but more coupling it's harder to replace something boom boo-boom boo-boom
36:19.369 right that's what we do as architecture they're basically the complete opposite of each other even though they built
36:25.279 from the same ingredients so the way I explain this right we like simple metaphor you know this is the Bill of
36:27.000 No text
36:31.250 Materials right this is ABCD so when you build a software this is the application server your database your firewall but
36:38.029 the catch is out of this stuff you can cook very different things you can make
36:42.000 No text
36:43.579 a amazingly tasty pizza or you can make this horrible line on our mill to cheese
36:47.000 No text
36:48.950 sandwich here right and that is in the connection so being a good chef right an
36:54.380 architect needs to be a good chef and a good chef is about how you put the ingredients together going to the market
37:00.289 and buying tasty Tomatoes it doesn't guarantee your good meal all right then the same is an IT buying high-quality
37:06.200 ingredients is a good start but making the tasty meal making the good architecture is something that lives in
37:10.000 No text
37:13.279 the connections it's all about how it's put together which leads me to another famous saying
37:18.440 that I have as somebody shows me an architecture picture that has no lines I basically tell them this is not an
37:24.590 architecture right because of all the behavior of all the important part is in the connections if somebody doesn't show
37:29.960 me any connections I'm like well this is not very useful people think it's a little bit mean but I actually mean it
37:35.510 right if there's no connections this architecture picture is probably not helpful now the interesting thing
37:41.270 about the architecture job is you will find that the connections live in many different universes so the one is
37:47.750 connections between layers right like you know layers of abstraction from business strategy to applications data
37:53.150 infrastructure and getting this aligned is a very important architecture function right and that's the value
37:58.460 chain largely we talked about but there's also things like you know connections between systems how is stuff
38:03.920 integrated right are they indicated at all how their silos as a point a point is the service bus has a big impact on
38:10.700 the way your systems behaves and lastly we don't live just in a technical world
38:15.950 we also live in the organizational side right there are connections between the different functions in the enterprise
38:22.070 and then also has a huge impact when James Lewis talked about platforms he talked a lot about this right if you
38:28.580 need to go to another department and wait two months to for a server moving to a cloud platform does not help you
38:34.670 all right because he's still waiting two months for the approval right so connections play the central role and
38:37.000 No text
38:40.550 the connections live in different universes right in different dimensions second important thing is the ability to
38:47.119 abstract right we saw the funny picture earlier right that is the reality you cannot use the reality to make
38:53.000 No text
38:53.540 intelligent decisions you use a model right embargo is our most important tool
38:59.210 to make decisions as architects because reality is too complex now the important thing is to understand is a model is not
39:06.500 reality it shouldn't be reality because the whole purpose of the model is to simplify reality so you can answer a
39:12.980 question or make a decision but then also means in order to find a good model you need to know what question you're
39:19.460 trying to answer so here's a classic example of four different Maps they're very different they show the same
39:26.050 the system planet Earth right but they look very differently and the reason they look so different is because they
39:31.810 answer different questions how do I hike from A to B or how do I Drive from here to there different questions so that
39:38.170 means if you make an architecture diagram which is a model in order to
39:43.270 make a good diagram you first need to know what question you're answering or what decision you're trying to make so
39:50.020 somebody says please show me you architecture it's a valid question to say what question you'd like to have
39:55.030 answered with my architecture right I don't draw architecture pictures as artwork they need to be driven by a
40:00.310 question or decision and you can turn this around if somebody shows you an architecture picture it is a valid
40:06.010 question to ask what decision does does this help me make and if I sound like
40:11.410 what do you mean then you're like well this is a model the purpose of the model is to help me make a decision right so
40:17.770 if you show me a model you must have some decision in mind right and if that is not there the architecture picture is
40:23.950 probably not very very useful so here's one example of an architecture model
40:29.800 right and this is what a lot of the enterprise architecture tools try to do and you can see a little bit it's trying
40:35.740 to make the connections right we talked about the connections are so important it's trying to make the connection
40:41.020 between business processes I think I have a laser beam er here maybe a drone [Music]
40:47.730 between the business objects and processes to the data and applications down to the infrastructure right so it's
40:54.280 trying to make these connections and that's what a lot of enterprise architecture tools do and that is actually a very useful thing the catch
402.410 is that a lot of people get lost in the complexity of the tool right it will come to that right it's not about
408.620 putting everything into the tool it's what gets you what you get out from the tool right the tool needs to help you
414.410 make decisions if it doesn't do that right it just wastes the time and money to put stuff into the tool
420.660 and the last one that's important in this abstraction is as an architect you
425.849 need to have a clear view of how this system fits together like how does this
431.220 system function and there's actually a classic anecdote to this and actually it comes out of India here and it's it's
433.000 No text
437.760 called the the Cobra effect right it's on the old days you know there's a lot of Cobras around and cobras are not very
443.849 friendly animals right so in you know the British folks said like what do we do right and I said like well we put a
450.329 reward out for a dead Cobra right so that people will kill the Cobra house and right so we make an incentive
456.000 right now of course what happens people start breathing cobras because it's a
42:02.599 source of income it's easy money right you just make sure the little copper is
42:08.359 all happy and say friend and the so hmm now of course ultimately people get get
42:14.329 wind of this right that the here suddenly there's a lot more cobras than you wanted to buy so they stopped paying
42:19.760 for these cobras now what of course happens the cobras now suddenly became worthless so you just release them so in
42:27.200 the end what started like a good idea ends up actually having the negative effect that's what we call simply for
42:33.559 because systems think and complex systems theory and a lot about making changes in these architectural
42:39.140 organizational system can have this same challenge so when you talk about the connections is very important to
42:45.289 understand those kind of effects you might have a good ideas like hey we give a reward for people now to get rid of
42:51.349 something we don't like it can lead to the exact opposite so this is also a very very important aspect for an
42:55.000 No text
42:58.160 architect last one I already painted at this point the point of a model is to
43:03.589 help you make a decision right and the example I often use is I ask people
43:04.000 No text
43:08.990 whether this is architecture and in the classic definition of architecture it probably passes the test
43:15.540 right the classic definition of architecture right it's the components the constraints right how it's put
43:21.450 together and this is perfect right the windows are there the door goes to the the door goes to the floor the windows
43:27.270 and the wall the roof is on the top right so it has all the definitions of classic architecture but for me it fails
43:33.930 the test because it doesn't represent any decisions well I have a very similar
43:39.180 example Oh actually have a good test for this the question is not is this architecture but the question you should
43:45.120 really ask is would you have paid an architect for this right and the answer then very most likely as no right
43:51.120 because there's no decision here this is cookie cutter I have a slightly different variation right to a house
43:57.270 that has a funny pointed roof and the roof is so pointed because it's in a cold climate right where it's nosed a lot and snow is
44:04.830 heaviest so I can crush your structure so they made a very pointed roof so there's snow gets gets off the roof now
44:10.680 here is a decision and suddenly I would say that makes an architecture right there's a decision made somebody put
44:17.520 some thought in it and for this you might have actually paid an architect
44:23.010 bringing this back to IT making decisions what I find that my worst pet
44:25.000 No text
44:28.500 peeve in the 90 years that people really get lost in the complexity of the system
44:33.600 and lose the decision discipline making decisions is relatively easy thing you
44:38.610 have some options you need to choose one of the options you have a clear guideline on what options you prefer
44:45.450 like I said right you want things that are automated things that can run into the cloud things that are open source
44:50.670 right those are the clear strategy and principles you look at the options you decide based on these options
44:56.610 the problem is in all this complexity people forget this right so you need to go back to the basics and be a
45:03.000 disciplined decision maker the one thing I like to remind people and I borrowed this from George Fairbanks book just
45:10.110 enough architecture is a decision that doesn't have a trade-off is usually not a very useful decision right and you
45:17.100 will find this in IT where people make a decision between something meaningful and something completely idiotic right
45:23.490 and then show a score chart and say well the meaningful decision look it's much more meaningful then this stupid thing
45:28.680 is like those are not useful decisions useful decisions have a trade-off we can
45:33.810 make the point roof the roof pointy so the snow falls off but there's a trade-off you're not gonna find any
45:39.960 furniture that he care to furnish you upper floor because your walls are gonna be like this right there is a trade-off
45:45.360 in a decision if there's no trade-off probably you haven't made a very
45:51.060 meaningful decision and what I'd like to do is what I like to add to George is the last sentence is mine if your
45:57.720 decision has a downside that we accept you should still have a strategy how you minimize that downside
46:04.260 so that's the role is architect as well to say like yes we understand right that
46:09.540 making things your hybrid cloud compatible can increase the complexity and here's what we're doing to to
46:15.480 minimize that so that brings us near the end of my talk right the last most
46:21.390 important advice here is that all this sounds rather logical right we had the
46:26.730 ATS eight steps in the value chain we have the key ingredients that you need to do right you need to consider the
46:31.980 connections you need to look at abstractions you need to make decisions the problem is it's never that easy
46:37.980 because this is a vast sea of fuzziness and I think that's where most enterprise
46:44.160 architects sort of get derailed they have the right intentions but because
46:49.590 it's so fuzzy they don't know where to really start so dividing and conquering
46:54.869 and having a measurable impact is probably the most important thing enterprise architects can do because
47:01.650 that keeps them out of the ivory tower but if you don't have measure all outcomes you will live in the ivory
47:06.810 tower and you will feel really good about it because life is nice and convenient but you're not producing any value for the enterprise that is a very
47:13.650 very bad thing so in the end I would say the takeaway is it's not black magic
47:14.000 No text
47:19.500 right a lot of it is common sense it's understanding the relationships between things it is prioritizing it is about
47:26.730 understanding how business and IT connects it is about making disciplined decisions making sure these decisions
47:33.570 are driven by common principles and common strategies right this is all stuff we do in daily life all the time
47:39.840 we know how to do this the key thing here is not to get lost in the
47:46.109 complexity of the domain or in the complexity of the tools and frameworks that can also happen right
47:52.490 the tool is a tool for you to achieve your goal the tool is not the goal right that is probably the most important
47:58.790 advice here and with that I'll end on a little bit more more personal note for
48:01.000 No text
48:04.160 me really if you look at my career I've seen quite a few different viewpoints of
48:09.350 IT I have I was a co-founder of a startup that worked a lot in consulting then I worked in Google as a software
48:16.070 engineer then I was a chief architect so on the end just as much as good architecture is about about combining
48:22.730 different viewpoints I think being successful in IT is also about combining different viewpoints
48:29.120 right understanding the organizational aspect understanding the technical aspects understanding the business
48:34.700 aspects right the more of these viewpoints you can combine the the stronger and the more successful you
48:41.720 will be in bringing this together and producing value for the enterprise and you will find that the demand for those
48:49.160 people is enormously high that is because the supply is so slim you will find very very few people who have seen
48:56.270 the different viewpoints on antion organizations and can bring them together in a meaningful way so I highly
49:03.650 encourage you to think about that and stretch your horizon hopefully I was able to give you a broader view of what
49:10.040 architecture is really all about and really I mean it seriously here right if
49:15.140 you can do that if you can get the broad view and translate that into measurable results companies will love you right
49:21.980 you will be really one of the few people who can feel this kind of spot so if you
49:27.000 No text
49:27.620 if you enjoyed this talk and some of the ideas the book is not about enterprise architecture but this is a book I wrote
49:33.770 very much about the role of Architects in a large organization mostly with the point of view of driving a
49:40.130 transformation scenario it is really a lot of little anecdotes write little stories but they have a sort of very
49:46.940 serious content a very serious underpinning so if there's an architect you'd like to engage at the higher
49:52.760 levels of your organization at more strategic architects here I read and you have a look a lot of the content
49:58.900 is on the website and if you like it you can you can have an e-book or a a paper book of this version so with that I
50:05.950 apologize for being five minutes over time but I think it's very much I'll be around today and tomorrow so if you have
50:12.130 questions just find me I think that's the easiest way we can have a chat thank you very much

# https://www.youtube.com/watch/KZZ80A2vRt8

02.440 hello and welcome everyone it's time for
05.600 another of course exciting episode of IT
09.040 career in Australia Channel and
10.960 tonight's topic is what does an
14.120 Enterprise architect do and how to
16.680 become one so join us for a panel
19.400 discussion on this road so our speakers
22.160 will our speakers will share their Creer
24.320 Journeys and typical responsibilities

29.199 of what it means to ensure an
31.800 organizational it strategy is aligned
34.079 with the business goals so this
35.879 conversation will explore various paths
38.680 to becoming Enterprise architect address
41.320 their daily challenges and decision they
43.680 face and hopefully offer some valuable
46.399 advice for those who considering or
49.800 transitioning into this role right now
51.960 so this session aims to demystify the

02:45.360 speakers to introduce themselves we'll
02:48.000 start with Jack
02:49.920 please hello everyone my name is Jack
02:52.440 I'm a contracted Enterprise architect
02:54.239 currently working at telra as well as a
02:56.280 few other little clients and on the side
02:58.480 I'm the interim CTO from for a couple of
03:00.400 small startups still in stealth
03:03.640 mode I love how you um uh working for
03:07.080 telra
03:08.440 and and we get like the the worst
03:12.360 internet connection is it I mean the
03:18.080 irony but we can hear you that's the
03:20.200 main thing Jack so that's that's you
03:22.319 know that's the main thing uh rala over
03:25.560 to you please um
03:30.519 yep hi everybody hope all is well um
03:33.959 yeah so I'm Ronaldo atenza I'm a
03:36.799 Enterprise architect at the moment with
03:38.640 the Department of Education and uh so
03:41.720 I've been I've been an Enterprise
03:43.439 architect for different organizations
03:45.799 and industries as well so you will learn
03:48.200 more about me later on uh thank you
03:51.879 thank you and over to Alex please hi
03:56.239 everyone Alex kirik I'm a Enterprise
03:58.799 architect with the large government
04:01.519 agency New South Wales transport for New
04:03.519 South Wales I'm mostly been an architect
04:05.720 in the in the government space um but
04:08.159 I've also been through the the startup
04:10.879 um Journey with a software development
04:13.239 company as well perfect thank you guys
04:17.519 so quite a few people joining us saying
04:19.478 hi s here he is here and Shad here if
04:25.040 I'm pronouncing your names incorrectly
04:27.400 please forgive me so I guess the first
04:29.560 question question I always ask is a bit
04:31.240 of a you know personal story so if you
04:33.600 can share with us you know your journey
04:35.840 into becoming Enterprise architect maybe
04:38.639 something inspired you to pursue this
04:40.639 role or maybe you know you um went to
04:43.280 primary school and you decided okay
04:45.280 that's it I'm gonna be Enterprise
04:48.199 architect when I grow up so so um guess
04:52.960 would love to would love to hear your
04:54.840 journey um and you know how you have you
04:58.000 made this transition uh maybe St of Alex
05:00.680 this time
05:02.639 please yes I wasn't always in the it
05:06.120 space um I did half of my career as a
05:09.440 separate profession
05:11.280 completely um and about I decided to
05:14.560 leave that completely behind and I was a
05:17.720 police officer by the way so totally
05:20.120 totally different and then I left and I
05:23.919 decided to transition to something else
05:25.800 and I chose it but the story behind it
05:28.440 is I always was a bit of a computer
05:31.199 gamer so I enjoyed computer games and I
05:33.520 used to build my own computers so I kind
05:36.120 of had that bit of it knowledge along
05:39.080 that way and then um that kind of led me
05:41.840 when I was deciding on a new career I I
05:44.360 I actually came back um came back to
05:47.759 work as a business analyst and Then
05:50.919 followed that bouncing ball along till
05:52.919 till uh my current role as an Enterprise
05:56.759 architect here we go from police officer
05:59.479 to to Enterprise architect guys if you
06:01.680 there listening and you think that you
06:03.360 know it's too late for you to transition
06:05.240 to Enterprise architect Maybe not maybe
06:08.080 you know maybe it's all always the way
06:11.759 um renala what about you how how did
06:14.360 your journey
06:15.599 EV yeah thanks Jana uh yeah my my
06:19.759 journey I think every great journey
06:21.840 begins with a single step and I think
06:24.360 mine is uh no different at all uh my my
06:27.880 first role is basically I was a soft
06:29.840 engineer in IBM and Computer Sciences
06:32.720 Corporation so I think for me it's just
06:35.240 really really uh learning how to
06:38.120 basically how to lay and all the bricks
06:41.720 and that Foundation as a software
06:44.000 engineer learning the technical skills
06:46.440 during that time and then from then I
06:49.120 gradually moved to a kind of solution
06:52.560 designer or solution architect from you
06:54.960 know different organization Victorian
06:56.960 government and telra Corporation as as I
07:00.080 mentioned and then from then uh reaching
07:04.240 to constructing a kind of skyscrapers or
07:07.199 we now as an Enterprise arketing leading
07:09.639 significant digital transformation of
07:11.680 projects of different uh non-for-profit
07:14.319 organizations before like Salvation Army
07:16.639 Heart Foundation uh telecommunication
07:19.560 industry and bootsman and tlra and
07:23.000 basically looking at B looking looking
07:25.840 at the Enterprise architecture
07:27.319 Frameworks engage stakeholders and
07:30.080 Implement any strategic it plan so so I
07:33.680 think I think that's really what
07:35.400 happened to me but really I I have that
07:38.000 passion in technology since I was young
07:40.280 so I love solving complex problems and
07:44.800 and I think what really drive is uh I
07:47.039 may I impact me to drive to become an
07:49.599 Enterprise architect is because of I
07:52.159 want to enhance the business outcomes of
07:54.919 of the business you know so I think I
07:57.680 think that's all about it thank you
08:00.319 y thank you H so Jack what about you so
08:04.120 we have non-technical and Technical
08:06.000 background so what what about
08:08.080 you um my journey not too dissimilar to
08:11.080 Ronaldo but uh probably what I would say
08:13.520 is I've the impact thing very very very
08:16.879 true I came up through help desks I was
08:19.280 a help desk technician a service desk
08:21.080 technician for schools for on the phones
08:24.520 I was a a software manager on the phones
08:27.599 for a long time providing support to
08:29.560 people not to Tech and through doing it
08:32.519 I realized that I couldn't just help the
08:34.200 people at some point I'd have to learn a
08:35.799 bit about and help the tech as well and
08:37.839 so I could did more and more in that and
08:39.599 it just eventually I was a manager and
08:41.799 then I was a platform owner and
08:43.200 eventually I found myself going I don't
08:45.000 think I can solve this problem just by
08:46.640 running things I think I need to design
08:48.320 them better and so that got me into a
08:50.279 solution designer and then eventually
08:52.279 into Enterprise architecture where I am
08:55.640 today makes sense M saying um amazing
08:59.640 Alex quite a journey yes definitely Alex
09:02.920 has a bit of a different journey and we
09:05.720 probably want to learn a bit more as
09:07.279 well but okay so so um I guess raldo and
09:11.360 Jack you have a little bit like kind of
09:13.079 similar similar journey and Alex you
09:15.240 move from a non-technical background but
09:17.200 do you think is such a thing as a
09:20.079 typical career path for someone aspiring
09:23.160 to become Enterprise architect like you
09:25.519 know is the what steps can people take
09:28.680 to to is it usually that sort of path
09:31.760 from the technical role into um you know
09:34.880 into Enterprise architecture or we can
09:37.560 see more and more than people moving
09:39.279 from the sort of more business business
09:41.839 background um Jack maybe we'll start
09:44.000 with you on this one first like yeah
09:46.360 what what what do you think is it such a
09:48.000 thing as a typical career path to
09:49.600 Enterprise
09:50.720 architecture I think there probably was
09:52.519 a time where having a technical
09:54.320 background was probably fair to be
09:55.959 considered the typical background coming
09:57.720 into architecture especially Enterprise
09:59.480 architecture more and more so these days
10:01.880 since the rise of you know product as a
10:03.920 as a way of thinking about how we build
10:05.519 Tech we're starting to see more and more
10:07.200 Architects that are coming from a a less
10:09.399 hardcore writing code background and
10:11.399 maybe from a background of we've managed
10:13.560 a product or I've managed a service or
10:15.560 maybe even people who've been working
10:17.000 heavily with digital assets these are
10:19.079 the sorts of people who also are finding
10:20.760 more and more they can find a pathway
10:23.600 in yeah yeah definitely Alex over to you
10:27.360 like I guess reflecting on your Journeys
10:29.360 as well what what do you think what's
10:31.920 what's a typical yeah and I don't fit
10:34.519 that mold but I totally agree with Jack
10:36.440 um traditionally that software
10:38.360 engineering software development that
10:40.519 sort of had a linear progression path to
10:44.120 um from that to you know managing a team
10:46.720 and then solution architecture and
10:48.519 eventually Enterprise domain
10:50.240 architecture and then Enterprise
10:52.000 architecture but um the the way I did it
10:54.560 was um yeah more from that business
10:56.720 space so starting off as a business
10:58.839 analyst you know Gathering requirements
101.079 and you eventually end up dabbling in a
103.279 bit of um solution design doing that and
106.360 then I stepped up from that and and went
108.079 into the Innovation space so as an
110.360 innovation officer we were doing proof
112.000 of concepts for technology so whether
114.279 we're implementing um body worn video or
117.399 tablets um you know out in the field or
121.360 all iot all different um you know new
124.600 new technologies in the organization and
127.399 again when you're document ing all that
130.120 you end up develop playing around with a
132.880 solution architecture and so that led me
135.560 into becoming a solution AR architect
138.920 and it was just a transfer and because
140.519 you're in a large government
141.519 organization and as a big it Department
144.279 you can transition across the different
146.079 teams so I might have been on a project
148.680 then I went into the Innovation you know
151.519 the strategy and technology and planning
154.040 unit and then moving to the Enterprise
157.160 architecture space as a solution
159.240 architect and yeah so there's plenty of
12:01.360 um way to move around and then after the
12:03.880 solution architect I did that for for
12:05.800 quite a few years and you start you know
12:08.959 getting more involved in the business
12:10.560 and you know dealing with the
12:12.079 stakeholders and then that leads you to
12:14.399 you know not just doing a particular
12:15.800 solution but doing you know strategies
12:17.639 for the organization and looking across
12:20.079 all the platforms rather than the single
12:22.160 platform and yeah me end up in as an
12:24.880 Enterprise architect after all that so
12:27.160 there is ways that that you can do that
12:29.959 from a non-software development
12:31.800 background it definitely helps but it's
12:34.199 not impossible to to do it without that
12:36.600 that software knowledge yeah and do you
12:39.320 think that the main knowledge really
12:40.720 help you because you've been I don't
12:42.839 know in in the government before and
12:44.399 knew how it works do you think that help
12:46.760 you to kind of you know move
12:48.519 horizontally and develop your different
12:50.480 skills I was very lucky in that I was a
12:53.600 business to start off with because I end
12:56.560 up being um an architect in the police
12:59.199 as well like I joined their it
13:01.120 department and so I had all that um
13:04.000 expert knowledge about the business
13:05.639 which really sort of gave me a head
13:07.600 start but for an architect coming into a
13:10.240 new business and and we'll probably talk
13:12.600 touch on it later too but one of the key
13:15.600 um key things you can pick up is is
13:19.160 getting to know the business very well
13:21.639 because that's going to help you
13:23.720 immensely yeah yeah definitely um
13:26.920 Ronaldo what about you what do you think
13:29.120 is there such a thing do you think your
13:30.720 career was typical Pathway to entprise
13:34.440 architecture um I don't think so to be
13:37.320 honest uh I can say I was an accidental
13:40.079 architect or something um when I say
13:42.760 accidental I because I remember I I
13:45.399 thought I'll just be a software engineer
13:47.199 a
13:48.000 developer uh but I think it transitioned
13:51.040 me as a solution designer or solution
13:53.240 architect Cu uh one of our solution
13:55.800 architect during that time uh left the
13:58.519 company when he was in ibbm and he left
14:01.199 and I was kind of the team lead for
14:03.279 developer so from then I I actually
14:06.480 transitioned to a solution designer
14:08.440 solution architect and same thing as
14:10.959 well when I transition to an Enterprise
14:13.360 architect is mostly that because the
14:16.000 team that I was moving uh it's kind of
14:18.920 because I was reporting to the Chief
14:20.440 Architect and they were thinking that I
14:22.040 think it's better if I move into the
14:24.120 Enterprise architect position so but I
14:26.759 think it it's it's it's good in a way
14:29.680 because uh as a software uh engineer I
14:33.480 developed a very broad technical
14:35.480 foundation and that helped me but when
14:38.120 you become an Enterprise architect you
14:40.880 need to have you need to have a
14:42.519 strategic thinking you need to enhance
14:44.480 your strategic thinking because it's
14:46.079 very important to look at how the it
14:48.759 aligns with business goals and how the
14:50.959 technology can drive the business value
14:53.600 and all that and and and and that that's
14:57.000 really I think probably what happened to
14:59.639 me so so but I'm kind of Hands-On
15:02.480 architect so I can talk on a different
15:05.480 language I can go to a uh you know to to
15:09.680 a penthouse or and going down to the uh
15:12.880 ground floor where I can talk to the
15:14.440 developers because I'm very techy and I
15:17.519 can go up to the executives where I can
15:19.680 talk business so I think that that's
15:22.600 probably the level where I I started as
15:25.279 a bottom and then go up as a as like an
15:27.600 elevator I think that's that's what I
15:29.360 can say thank you
15:31.319 Jana thank you um thank you guys so um
15:35.360 few people saying quite impressive
15:37.399 Journey Jack's history is similar to
15:40.040 mine here we go so um let's let's try to
15:44.399 um demystify a little bit the the the
15:46.959 actual the role of Enterprise architect
15:49.360 you already mentioned you know few
15:50.800 responsibilities and stuff but you know
15:53.880 if you would describe the day in life of
15:56.920 Enterprise architect what would you
15:59.040 describe as the sort of primary primary
16:02.199 responsibilities um for the Enterprise
16:04.519 architect um Ronaldo we'll start with
16:06.880 you this time
16:08.279 please uh primary okay the the primary
16:11.959 responsibilities of uh an Enterprise
16:14.360 architect I think the number one uh
16:17.839 straight away I think I mentioned a
16:19.399 while ago is that uh an Enterprise
16:22.000 architect need to have that strategic
16:24.199 planning so I think we we need to be
16:27.480 responsible on the over all IP
16:29.519 architecture of that entire organization
16:31.519 and make sure it aligns to all the
16:33.680 business goals and strategies so and
16:36.720 then usually I do uh we we set up an
16:40.240 architectural governance so you need to
16:42.440 establish these so because you need to
16:44.199 have specific architectural principles
16:46.240 in governance to basically say this is
16:49.519 for the all the IT projects these are
16:51.399 the compliance and regulatory
16:53.079 requirements or industry best practices
16:55.240 that we need to do and um you know you
16:58.040 need to have kind of responsibility to
17:00.399 make sure that you have a long-term
17:02.600 vision and I think it's very important
17:05.439 to have that stakeholder management as
17:07.520 well uh you know that talk to the
17:10.640 Business Leaders and really understand
17:12.640 what they really need uh you know and
17:15.319 and make sure that you understand and
17:17.480 and alignment on that specific it
17:19.839 strategies so it's like we're we're
17:21.799 really acting as a bridge between
17:23.439 business and it so and at the at at the
17:27.199 end I think it's probably
17:29.679 I can say the last one is the risk
17:31.400 management and optimization so we need
17:34.160 to identify the specific risk and trying
17:37.679 to mitigate mitigating all those risk
17:40.600 associated with any architectural
17:43.120 decisions we've made is a is a very
17:45.039 crucial as
17:46.840 well um Jack anything to kind of add to
17:51.280 this list what is your day look like or
17:53.640 is it similar to
17:55.679 ralda I think it's a great list um I was
17:58.600 just thinking about what percentage of
18:00.159 my time I spend doing those different
18:02.240 things I and I think I spend about 20%
18:05.000 of my time personally working on still
18:07.120 working on Hands-On Tech stuff not
18:09.640 probably these days because I have to
18:11.280 but these days because it helps to have
18:12.760 an awareness of it and keep across it
18:14.480 and how it works I probably spend about
18:16.880 40% of my time dealing with the things
18:19.159 that are in my patch so that's the
18:21.240 solutions or the systems that fit fit
18:23.360 under my area that I own in terms of
18:25.400 Enterprise architecture so for me it's
18:26.919 all the risk and compliance and legal
18:28.480 things CU that's the team I'm currently
18:29.840 assigned to and then the other 40% of my
18:32.200 time I spend working on those larger
18:34.720 chunkier and pure Enterprise
18:36.600 architecture things I would say and
18:38.039 that's coming up with patterns and
18:39.799 Frameworks and systems that the rest of
18:41.480 the business can roll out it's also just
18:43.280 sitting down with my other fellow
18:44.480 Enterprise Architects and the business
18:46.000 and and understanding what their
18:47.360 requirements are and what's their budget
18:48.720 for the next year and so yeah it's it's
18:51.200 about 20% keeping myself sharp 40%
18:53.960 keeping the things that I own right here
18:55.520 and right now sharp and running and 40%
18:58.000 making sure that that broadly everything
18:59.840 we're doing is aligned with the the
19:01.440 picture and the road map and we're all
19:02.720 going in the same
19:04.360 direction makes sense um Alex over to
19:07.960 you is your day similar to
19:10.840 this or something I love ral's analogy
19:14.200 of the elevator I feel like I'm on that
19:16.400 elevator all day long because I've got a
19:19.400 um it's quite an interesting role I'm an
19:21.679 Enterprise architect but I belong in a
19:23.799 platforms management team so we look
19:26.480 after a whole bunch of um platforms
19:29.240 and then that I ride that elevator so I
19:31.200 might be one minute creating a ticket to
19:34.480 create a service account or something
19:36.880 you know to support a project or
19:39.240 creating a an environment for them in or
19:42.440 spinning up a VM and then you know
19:45.679 second half of my day I'll be preparing
19:47.760 a an architecture pack to go to the
19:50.280 architecture review board for a decision
19:52.440 so that's like kind of those middle
19:53.799 levels and then you know up the top of
19:56.520 the at the penthouse I'd be um looking
19:58.960 working with a few stakeholders across
20:00.799 the organization we're looking at AI
20:02.559 governance and cyber guardrails at the
20:05.240 moment so looking at like a strategic
20:07.480 piece that'll uh be binding across the
20:09.799 whole organization so yeah my day is
20:13.320 never boring because because I do it's
20:15.720 quite varied in that that
20:17.880 space Sounds like yeah you know it's a
20:20.880 bit of a variety there B that
20:23.720 elevator example that he can you know he
20:26.280 can go to um different levels and my
20:29.000 next question kind of similar I guess
20:30.760 you already have answer that but um I
20:33.799 think what's what's like how important
20:36.760 those soft skills for Enterprise
20:38.400 architect compare the technical
20:40.480 expertise so you know you're mentioning
20:42.440 you still need to go down elevator you
20:44.480 know to some technical stuff and talk
20:46.520 with developers and you know how yeah
20:49.760 how technical Enterprise architect
20:52.120 should be so I don't know what's what
20:54.400 kind of your opinion and um we might
20:57.480 start with Jack this
201.720 uh sure so very um I think sort of to
205.440 give the Counterpoint what we said
206.840 before having a technical Foundation to
208.919 your skills it helps uh but whether or
211.360 not you will use those technical skills
213.120 every day as an Enterprise architect I
214.799 doubt it you will spend most of your
216.760 time working with stakeholders in the
218.840 business to understand their
220.000 requirements but you'll also be spending
222.600 an equal amount of time working with
224.000 Engineers trying to understand their
225.559 requirements or to argue with them
227.400 whether or not their requirements are
228.840 exactly what they actually need because
230.760 you've now got visibility over three or
232.279 four platforms so it's not just about
235.279 this is the way to go this is the answer
236.919 to the solution you spend a lot of time
238.720 negotiating negotiating with
240.320 stakeholders negotiating with Engineers
241.880 or even negotiating with your fellow
243.240 Architects these are all soft skills
245.320 these all need you to build a network to
246.919 build credibility and to build trust so
249.000 very very important I
251.279 think y y um Alex you know you soft
255.600 skills winning in this in this role
259.440 yeah they they're very important um I I
22:01.799 attend the architecture review boards
22:03.760 quite a lot and to present um whatever
22:07.480 it is a pattern a framework a solution
22:10.440 or whatever for a decision and you have
22:12.960 to have that communication be able to
22:14.760 all those soft skills and communication
22:16.640 to be able to articulate the
22:18.000 recommendations properly and to also
22:20.120 answer the questions and often there's
22:22.039 resistance there's a bit of push back
22:24.000 there's arguments so you you need to to
22:26.600 to have that um you need to articulate
22:28.520 yourself well and and what you're trying
22:30.480 to to to deliver the other important one
22:33.400 is leadership being and showing a bit of
22:36.520 initiative and pushing your initiative
22:39.559 through or your strategy or whatever and
22:41.480 convincing stakeholders that's very
22:43.039 important as well and no one's going to
22:45.840 in it's a senior role so no one's going
22:47.640 to spoon feed you every day is what you
22:49.640 need to do you need to actually pick up
22:51.760 the ball and and run with it so that's
22:53.720 very important as
22:55.159 well yeah yeah there's definitely a
22:57.520 number of um skills ralo something to
23:00.400 add to the important skills and software
23:03.919 is
23:05.640 technical yes thank you yeah I mean soft
23:08.960 SK soft skills are very important if you
23:11.320 want to be an Enterprise architect
23:13.039 initially I thought it's not but it's
23:14.799 very important I think for an Enterprise
23:17.640 architect I think you need to be a
23:19.559 translator what I mean of translator
23:21.679 that you can speak both business and
23:23.880 technology so just as a translator you
23:26.919 need to ensure that you know people from
23:29.640 different cultures that you're talking
23:31.480 to understand each other you make sure
23:34.240 that the technical guys and the business
23:37.279 make sure that both of them the both
23:39.640 sides of that organization are actually
23:42.080 talking on a different language and
23:43.960 making sure those two groups are on the
23:47.520 same page and the same book as well so
23:51.200 and I think that's very very crucial I
23:54.279 I've experienced a lot of Mis
23:56.360 miscommunication and that's why I said
23:58.640 Enterprise architect as a translator and
24:01.120 I can say as well uh as as
24:04.240 uh uh uh the leadership and influence is
24:07.440 also very important so I can say that
24:10.080 the leadership and influence is like I
24:12.559 felt like I'm just a conductor of an
24:14.640 orchestra so the conductor you know
24:17.200 doesn't play the instruments but guides
24:19.200 the musician to play Harmony yeah so I
24:22.240 guide the teams to ensure that all those
24:24.320 different efforts of those different
24:26.360 departments are aligned for our
24:28.559 strategic Vision so we're not only a
24:30.640 translator but also we're a conductor so
24:35.240 having a collaboration and teamwork is
24:37.600 is very important and I and you know
24:39.360 that collaboration and teamwork is like
24:41.200 having a sports team and and winning the
24:44.760 game requires win uh teamwork and
24:47.240 collaboration so you need to ensure that
24:49.399 the team members work together
24:52.840 toward you know finishing the line and
24:55.440 the common goal and uh yeah yeah I think
24:58.640 these are the things and I think one
25:00.120 important very most important part is
25:02.880 having that emotional intelligence when
25:05.760 I say emotional intelligence I think
25:08.720 think of it as a skilled therapist so if
25:11.039 you're a therapist you must understand
25:13.000 and empathize with their your clients
25:15.520 help them even the people the technical
25:18.320 guys the business and must empathize
25:21.120 your colleagues effectively and how
25:22.840 you're going to support them and do
25:24.799 their work properly as well so I think I
25:26.840 think that's what I can say thank thank
25:28.679 you yeah definitely quite a few soft
25:32.320 skills involved there and I like that
25:34.080 you mention the same page of the same
25:36.279 book because sometimes you feel like on
25:38.039 the same page with people uh but you
25:40.799 actually it just feel that you're in the
25:42.600 same page but you're in a completely
25:43.880 different
25:45.320 book I think that's that's something to
25:48.640 be aware of um just few comments I was
25:52.080 just want to quickly acknowledge s like
25:55.760 J journey is aspiring I started my
25:57.399 journey as well as this system engineer
25:59.000 I can relate myself and his task also
26:02.559 Alex inter Tech from police is
26:04.520 impressive as well man saying hi
26:06.679 everyone really appreciate the insights
26:08.520 all these professions are providing to
26:10.440 us on this show thank you uel and yes a
26:13.880 great inside sharing health information
26:15.720 for us we are junior in this domain and
26:17.559 the ideas knowledge awesome here you go
26:19.720 thank you thank you guys for for being
26:22.200 here so um the next question I have and
26:25.960 guys who's who's still um who's a
26:28.399 watching us and or even if you're
26:30.000 watching replay uh feel free to drop
26:32.279 some questions in the comments so we
26:34.399 happy to take some questions from the
26:36.080 audience so um as long as you stay on
26:38.360 the topic yes Enterprise architecture
26:40.399 topic um so my next question is um you
26:43.919 know the most common challenges of um
26:46.880 you know Enterprise Architects face in
26:49.039 their day-to-day responsibility and
26:50.919 maybe just give you personal opinion
26:53.240 yeah uh not don't don't talk in general
26:55.799 that's you know the hard part of the
26:57.279 being Enterprise
26:58.880 what you personally like maybe don't
27:02.000 really like as much I find it a bit like
27:04.679 ah like you know I have to do it again
27:08.520 um Alex maybe we'll start with you
27:10.799 what's what's what you think the biggest
27:13.039 challenge kind of for you in in this
27:16.039 role as I mentioned before as an
27:18.120 Enterprise architect you have to make
27:19.880 recommendations whether you're
27:21.240 recommending a platform or a strategy or
27:24.440 a product or a solution that's always
27:26.880 going to upset someone
27:29.640 because um however good your
27:31.799 recommendation is and the justifications
27:34.360 behind it there's always people in the
27:36.279 business that might be used to another
27:38.559 solution or another platform or another
27:40.720 way of doing things and involves change
27:43.080 and whenever um there's change that's
27:45.600 triggered there's always going to be
27:46.919 some resistance so you need to know how
27:49.679 to deal with that resistance whether you
27:52.000 sell them the benefits or highlight the
27:54.080 risks or you know work with them to
27:56.880 incorporate their concerns or address
27:59.320 their concerns in some way so that's
28:01.559 probably one of the biggest challenges
28:02.799 of an architect the push back and the
28:04.480 resistance you get and how to overcome
28:06.559 that so that's where those soft skills
28:08.200 come into play as well um the other sort
28:11.039 of challenge that I think is common is
28:14.440 as an Enterprise Archer you get stuck in
28:16.399 the weeds um you end up uh you know like
28:19.559 I do sometimes you end up as a as a
28:22.279 support Channel and if you've helped
28:24.039 someone out or you helped a few people
28:25.600 out they've always got your name and
28:27.200 they keep coming back here for and your
28:29.600 day can be totally lost if you're not
28:31.880 careful in operational issues rather
28:33.840 than on the you know the bigger pit of
28:36.480 stuff that you're meant to be working on
28:37.919 so that that's another challenge and and
28:40.159 sometimes that other stuff's fun or but
28:42.799 it's very timec consuming as well so you
28:45.000 got to uh prioritize your
28:47.919 workload yes yeah prioritization don't
28:50.960 we all like that You' like that task
28:54.799 Jack over to you what do you find you
28:57.200 know challenging
28:59.120 I really struggle with the idea of
29:00.919 architecture when um I think there's in
29:04.279 any solution any any proof of concept
29:07.480 any pilot you build there is always an
29:10.120 opportunity for you to do more
29:11.640 architecture you can do more design you
29:14.080 can do more diagram you can do more of
29:16.159 the network flows in a nice table but at
29:18.880 what point are you doing too much
29:20.240 architecture and not enough building at
29:21.880 what point does a build not need to be
29:24.120 designed what when can it just be
29:25.919 experimental um I struggle with this a
29:27.880 lot especially in the Innovation space
29:29.399 and especially in Services the business
29:31.799 hasn't decided if it wants to acquire
29:33.799 yet it's just taste testing them to see
29:35.279 if it will later um in a lot of spaces
29:37.840 like that where there's ambiguity I I I
29:40.120 often struggle with it do we need as
29:42.039 much architecture as we have do we maybe
29:43.720 need a little less or also from us as
29:46.240 Architects what tools and what
29:48.279 Frameworks can we give people who don't
29:50.200 understand architecture so at that level
29:52.320 they can still make some smart decisions
29:54.120 can still build their things in good
29:55.519 repeatable ways without needing a full
29:57.760 Des design or one of us to spend an hour
29:59.760 with
30:01.240 them yeah makes sense um Ronaldo over to
30:06.320 you um is it challenges similar or
30:09.840 something different yeah yeah yeah I
30:12.440 think it's more similar but I think I
30:14.960 think the main challenges for me I think
30:17.679 from more my experience is
30:20.120 basically uh I think I can say it's like
30:24.039 I'm I'm trying to I'm always trying to
30:26.880 adjust you know the sales like you know
30:29.720 I'm trying to sell the ship and to to
30:32.480 match the changing wind directions there
30:34.919 there's a lot of different changes on
30:37.279 the requirements so there's or sometimes
30:40.200 there's a business the business will
30:42.120 change their mind or this and then that
30:44.279 just like a sailor that you must I think
30:46.559 you constantly Monitor and adjust the
30:48.960 sales to keep the ship on course because
30:52.799 a lot of changes like even though you're
30:54.799 already in the middle of designing or
30:57.360 developing something already and then
30:59.159 suddenly there's a change of course even
301.880 politically they're going to say ah we
303.320 don't have a budget already or these and
305.679 that or the schedule as what Jack is
308.240 saying is and all that so I think that
311.000 for me is one of the one of the uh uh
314.880 challenges so you have to go to the tide
317.360 or how you going to influence that tide
319.720 so that you can make sure the shifting
322.320 business goals is is kind of you know uh
326.039 you you're always into it uh that's what
329.279 I can say yep thank you definitely we
333.440 have quite a few um questions coming up
336.799 um so utash has quite a specific
339.799 question so um Alex have an answer for
343.519 him but a look of it so I have a I have
346.559 a attended RBS and I also worked at TPM
350.519 where I contributed to S um streamlining
353.039 and Cloud Edge and streamlining what
355.159 should I do next to become Enterprise
357.320 architect
358.679 Alex did you wanna um yeah I was just
32:01.360 gonna say because I saw the next
32:02.760 question as well from Chris and it's
32:04.679 kind of related as I see EA is something
32:07.440 which I see is something which only
32:10.080 applies to large organization yeah what
32:12.080 do you think is a minimum size of
32:14.240 organization yeah the two questions are
32:16.399 kind of related because um firstly for
32:18.919 udash um to do next is the way I did it
32:22.760 was if you're in an IT team at the
32:25.240 moment and you're doing that solution
32:26.480 architect you try to find the unit in
32:28.880 your organization that looks after
32:31.120 strategy uh Enterprise architecture or
32:34.039 governance or business architecture
32:36.240 usually the there's a business unit that
32:39.039 is and it's usually removed from the
32:40.919 actual it development teams so if you
32:43.000 can get a a foothold into there the
32:46.360 Enterprise architect role would would
32:48.120 come naturally so that that that's one
32:49.760 way to do it and um for for Chris's
32:53.080 question um it doesn't have to be a
32:55.760 large organization even if if it's a
32:58.240 small one you can still do EA work in a
33:01.159 small
33:02.200 organization um by looking at the bigger
33:04.480 picture of it so not just sort of you're
33:06.720 implementing one software package but
33:08.519 then have a look at all the the the
33:12.159 market space for that type of software
33:14.519 and then come up with a recommendation
33:16.559 so immediately you're sort of elevating
33:18.639 from that implementing specific software
33:21.519 product to looking at that whole Market
33:23.799 space for that genre of product and
33:26.679 making analysis and seeing what will fit
33:29.080 your organization so yeah you can do EA
33:32.480 work in a smaller organization that's I
33:35.519 know it doesn't
33:37.919 um yeah there's more opportunities in a
33:40.720 larger organization definitely and they'
33:42.399 got those dedicated teams that are
33:43.919 focused on Enterprise architecture but
33:46.159 you can always practice Enterprise
33:47.840 architecture regardless of the size of
33:49.679 the
33:50.840 organization Ma and Jack anything to add
33:54.399 yeah no I I I love that I think that's
33:57.320 very true through you an Enterprise
33:59.279 architect as a role you there might not
34:01.320 be one in a small org but as a as a
34:03.799 capacity as a capability that org needs
34:05.960 to and and can use always there's always
34:08.119 room for a little bit somewhere um in
34:10.239 terms of a practical Next Step y
34:12.119 absolutely if you can get a foothold
34:13.440 into an architecture team do it if you
34:15.800 can't I highly recommend you start
34:18.040 owning things so if you can take on the
34:20.599 ownership of a platform the ownership of
34:22.440 a service and you can own its design its
34:24.399 future its road map you are then
34:26.399 starting to get into a world you are a
34:28.199 solution architect and then if you're
34:29.800 thinking about how the thing that you
34:31.000 own interacts with the things outside of
34:33.079 it now you're almost in Enterprise
34:34.960 architecture so being a solution owner
34:37.520 or a solution designer can be a really
34:39.320 good stepping stone as
34:41.199 well makes sense um ronal anything to
34:45.040 add to this or did we answer the
34:47.599 questions I guess yeah yeah I think I
34:50.359 think I can add uh CU I've I've been to
34:53.599 an organization really small about 250
34:56.560 or I think I don't know 400 employees
34:59.359 and I think that the enterprise we I did
35:02.240 an Enterprise architect but I I was
35:04.000 wearing a lot of hats not only
35:05.480 Enterprise architect solution architect
35:07.359 and application architect and all that
35:09.720 so you actually need to own it and then
35:11.880 try to put in what should be the digital
35:13.920 transformation of these how what's the
35:15.640 target State and all that I think my
35:18.079 advice here it's it's really it doesn't
35:20.599 matter small medium large you still need
35:22.680 to have a an Enterprise architect for
35:25.320 the reason that it could it will improve
35:27.440 your operational efficiency and you know
35:30.320 try to find how you're going to the cost
35:32.520 to be lower reduces redundancy or
35:35.359 whatever so it's kind of finding an
35:38.400 improvement for the company you know how
35:40.839 you know on how can you deliver all
35:42.760 these Improvement and outcomes for for
35:45.280 the company so I think I think that's
35:47.079 what I need to add there thank you would
35:49.200 would this role just C differently like
35:51.680 what what would be you know in the small
35:53.800 organization if like you know let's say
35:56.440 there's no Enterprise such who's doing
35:58.839 the Enterprise architecture in a small
36:01.880 organization
36:05.640 usually the company technologist you can
36:08.760 just simply be a technologist and
36:11.240 and
36:13.359 or yeah and and and create something
36:16.599 create an artifact or a a solution
36:19.200 options paper or you know design or
36:21.960 anything or a strategy or a pathway or
36:25.079 something and provide that up to
36:26.480 management and see what they think and
36:28.440 there you go you're an Enterprise
36:30.680 architect guess would be maybe head of
36:32.920 Engineering in a small organization or
36:36.640 someone yeah it can even be a team lead
36:39.720 it can be the CTO it can be the chief
36:42.079 product officer it can really be anyone
36:44.319 who's in a in a in a position where
36:46.079 they've got a level of visibility and a
36:48.240 level of ability to make
36:50.760 decisions yeah yeah so here you go so
36:53.640 don't need to be in a big organization
36:55.640 so just think about you know think about
36:57.640 responsibilities and the pathway um and
37:01.280 I guess on this topic also just a quick
37:03.800 question to all of you what's um like if
37:06.160 you really I guess quickly answer that
37:07.920 question what do you think the main
37:10.000 difference and you also answer it in a
37:12.280 way but what's the main difference
37:13.920 between solution architect and
37:15.440 Enterprise architect if you would you
37:18.119 know kind of like describe it and and
37:20.160 and like have one point um Jack what
37:23.920 what what do you think I mean for me it
37:27.119 it usually means owning more than like a
37:30.119 solution more than more than a handful
37:31.839 of solutions so solution architect might
37:33.800 own one they might own up to three or
37:35.240 four or five but they won't normally
37:37.640 consider the Integrations between those
37:39.720 Solutions the moment you're at a space
37:41.760 where you're owning multiple Solutions
37:43.560 or an entire domain worth of solutions
37:45.839 and how they integrate with each other
37:47.560 but also with the wider business then
37:49.480 you're starting to play in some would
37:51.200 call that still domain architecture but
37:53.119 in my experience that's still pretty
37:54.319 close to what we do in
37:56.040 Enterprise Ronaldo is um that's how do
37:59.400 you see the difference when you move
38:00.760 from solution to kind of
38:02.760 Enterprise yeah yeah I think I think
38:05.800 it's really a big difference the way I
38:07.960 see it because the my analogy here the
38:10.760 Enterprise architect is a is a city
38:13.240 planner a master C city planner looking
38:15.839 at the perspective of where is the
38:18.960 different infrastructure where we going
38:20.480 to put the Train the roads and all that
38:23.359 while while a solution architect is
38:25.520 really is an individual building
38:27.880 architect or you know building a one
38:30.680 story house or a double story house so
38:33.200 that's a solution architect for me so so
38:36.359 Enterprise architect is looking at the
38:38.280 whole kind of town the whole city you
38:41.040 know if you're want to build the whole
38:43.880 modern city how you going to build that
38:46.359 what you talk to the different
38:48.040 businesses right and what what do you
38:50.599 wanted and then and then you're kind of
38:52.599 helping them to build out where is that
38:55.280 need to be located the roads the
38:56.920 infrastructure the train and everything
38:59.040 that's the Enterprise architecture and
39:01.200 then for for so you're basically a
39:04.079 master uh city planner while a solution
39:07.160 architect is really a a building
39:09.599 architect that oversees the design and
39:12.160 construction of the specific building
39:15.200 okay so I think I think that's the way I
39:18.119 I GNA describe it uh in in analogy form
39:21.400 so thank you yeah and I think we have a
39:24.680 um similar question here maybe Alex you
39:27.240 can and kind of like you know continue
39:29.240 and take this one I'm a contract
39:31.560 solution architect how I can move up the
39:33.960 ladder to perform Enterprise
39:35.960 architecture all job as I don't get the
39:38.520 luxury of luxury of being permanent
39:40.680 employee to exercise which my role
39:42.880 within the
39:44.599 organization and I think well probably a
39:48.520 good thing is to do an initiative on the
39:51.520 side that's related to Enterprise
39:53.119 architecture so whatever role you're
39:55.359 doing now just try and pick up something
39:57.920 that you know is a pain point in that
39:59.599 company or that organization and try to
40:01.839 solve it in terms of solution options
40:04.359 and make some recommendation as to what
40:08.119 the company strategy should be in terms
40:10.040 of solving that problem just as an
40:12.160 example um and that
40:14.560 way I think you'll come under notice and
40:17.079 it'll probably give you a lot more
40:18.240 opportunity so anyone can really do that
40:20.599 um just uh yeah take a bit extra on and
40:24.440 and try and try and Shine from the rest
40:28.200 yeah um anyone want to add anything for
40:32.920 think a bit will and and just the the
40:36.599 previous conversation about the
40:38.000 difference between solution and I'll
40:39.880 give you a real world example sort of
40:41.960 for solution architecture I might be
40:43.640 looking at um the powerbi the whole
40:46.839 analytics and visualization space so I
40:49.319 might be looking how to implement
40:50.800 powerbi and the connectivity patterns
40:53.280 and how to like the where the Gateway
40:56.359 sits to get data source and do all that
40:59.119 design but from an Enterprise
400.520 architecture perspective I might be
402.680 looking at the whole visualization
405.520 strategy and across all the different
407.560 tool sets that are available in the
408.880 market and then nominate okay these are
411.599 strategic tools with the highest
413.119 capability Set uh we should use those
416.599 but there's also if there's some Niche
418.839 um areas of of use cases I recommend
422.240 these tactical tools and that kind of
423.839 thing you can see it's like a total Step
425.720 Up
427.599 yeah and now here's a quick question I
429.440 think we kind of touch it on a bit does
432.599 Enterprise also take care of the
435.640 data yeah you could touch any domain um
439.359 you you could like like I just mentioned
441.119 that visualization and the analytics
442.960 place or you could um and sometimes
446.440 there's roles too like there's specific
448.200 data architect roles um or specific U
451.480 you know Network architect data
453.119 architect there's a generic domain
455.280 architect where you could specialize
456.800 across different um but as a e EA you
42:00.079 could be assigned to work um on a data
42:02.640 project like I was looking at data
42:04.240 bricks on um in a for example just as a
42:09.480 and I've got no idea about that you know
42:12.359 but you're assign that and that the
42:14.359 question here how how much is industry
42:16.240 domain knowledge needed to become an
42:18.000 Enterprise architect from
42:20.599 summeran I might not be an expert in in
42:24.160 and I'm not an expert in a lot of those
42:26.040 fields but the key tricks is to know who
42:28.880 is and to pick their brains and it's
42:31.559 amazing how much you you'll learn from
42:34.200 the actual industry domain experts so if
42:36.559 you've got a good Network in your
42:38.000 organization and outside as well of
42:40.760 those uh industry experts you you'll be
42:44.520 surprised how quick they'll rub off on
42:46.000 you and you'll pick up that knowledge
42:47.400 really quick so even though you don't
42:49.160 have the industry domain knowledge find
42:51.280 out quickly who does and um and get them
42:54.160 to
42:55.040 help yeah coming back to those you know
42:57.800 communication skills I guess and the
42:59.359 soft skills um we'll just move on to
43:01.839 different questions I guess you know we
43:03.960 have quite a few questions coming up and
43:06.319 only 15 minutes left um Louise is asking
43:10.119 how can you be confident in your
43:13.160 dealings or recommendation when you have
43:15.040 not been working in the area um which
43:18.240 the subject of meta expertise spent
43:20.319 every day
43:23.359 on yeah just sorry sorry to cut in again
43:26.559 but exactly what what I just said um
43:28.599 there's so many smes in your
43:30.960 organization that work downstairs in the
43:33.839 server room in the network Department in
43:36.960 um you know the data science space uh
43:40.000 once you build those contacts and you en
43:43.000 list them to help and get them to review
43:45.280 your documentation so you might have no
43:47.359 idea but you draft you do a starting
43:49.520 point and get them to review it or
43:52.160 interview them so just as a business
43:54.000 analyst would sit down with them um get
43:57.400 some info from it articulate that and
43:59.359 get them to review it and you're
44:02.480 essentially you're like coordinating all
44:04.559 the smes to to put together an a
44:07.520 strategy an artifact the solution
44:09.720 options whatever the case
44:11.880 is Ral do you want to add anything to
44:16.680 this uh I think but what I gonna add is
44:20.680 basically if you probably need to you
44:24.040 know need to understand some kind of
44:25.920 architectural framework like toaf if you
44:28.720 if you're a solution architect moving
44:30.559 into that realm uh toap zakman
44:33.920 framework and yeah and and at the same
44:36.960 time if you really you you have to do
44:40.680 your I mean as part of an Enterprise
44:42.880 architect you really need to do your own
44:45.040 research you need to do some readings
44:47.440 about new technologies about AI you have
44:50.760 to educate yourself there's a lot of
44:52.800 courses and you know you can look at it
44:54.960 and and just understand understand the
44:57.680 the structure and how how you know
44:59.920 understand how it works and all that and
45:01.640 then there's some people can help you as
45:03.200 well but usually as an Enterprise you
45:05.599 you have to build up those different
45:08.119 Technologies you know in in data in
45:11.040 Security in network in the more the more
45:15.119 uh tools you know the more kind of old
45:18.520 things applications forr everything it's
45:20.800 kind of it's a broad Enterprise
45:22.920 architect is Broad solution architect I
45:25.000 I can say it's it's kind of specific
45:27.400 there's some specific solution architect
45:29.520 Microsoft 365 for example but an
45:32.079 Enterprise architect you you kind of
45:34.119 need to know data and any other types of
45:37.240 Technology even the new technologies
45:39.160 coming in now it's AI blockchain
45:41.200 technology what are the different use
45:43.280 cases now on these companies for
45:44.920 payments and all that you need to
45:46.760 understand that now because these are
45:48.079 the new future now that these are the
45:49.920 ones that will be in the future but
45:52.640 again you need to know all of that as an
45:54.319 Enterprise architect
45:57.079 yeah sounds like a lot a lot a lot to be
46:00.359 aware of um I'm just jumping to next
46:03.880 question just so we can you know answer
46:06.040 more questions um here go you mentioned
46:09.079 about TOA already what cses like um TOA
46:13.520 for some strategy planning would you
46:15.040 recommend to um qualify for AAL do you
46:18.280 have any recomend specific
46:25.200 recommendations uh I find it really hard
46:28.280 to find specific architecture courses
46:32.319 that's always been lacking in the
46:34.720 industry there is like toga for example
46:37.440 and there's uh kobit and a few other
46:40.160 little things actually I think I found
46:42.240 one an introduction to solution
46:44.160 architecture was really high level but
46:46.680 all I can recommend is that don't just
46:49.599 focus uh in on trying to find an
46:52.520 Enterprise architecture course or any
46:54.960 architecture course go over a few
46:57.680 different domains go project management
47:00.720 uh look at some of the security courses
47:03.720 look at um some of the service
47:06.599 management courses get all the basics
47:09.760 done have a look at some of the cloud
47:12.079 courses you know and different product
47:14.520 courses whether it's you know in the
47:15.960 aure space or the you know Google or
47:18.520 even products of low code platform space
47:21.000 like Power Platform or Salesforce
47:23.119 service now it gives you that whole
47:25.160 breath of knowledge um
47:27.359 and all that will contribute to your
47:29.079 skills and and assist you in be being an
47:33.599 architect yeah
47:37.880 so yeah I'd go almost a step further on
47:40.559 the advice which is I would avoid
47:42.559 Frameworks like toaf I'd avoid
47:44.599 Frameworks like arim mate at first I
47:47.160 think they are something to really
47:48.640 they're really really good to tie your
47:50.599 Enterprise architecture knowledge
47:52.160 together at a later point and you should
47:54.839 get your business to pay for them but
47:58.359 realistically realistically you can be
48:00.520 an Enterprise architect without that
48:01.960 framework as long as you've got the
48:03.440 experience the knowhow and the network
48:05.599 so focus on those things
48:07.520 first y y the the actual experience um
48:11.599 so one more question here from shuy I'm
48:14.599 a tof 10 certified practitioner here you
48:17.119 go I was a system software application
48:19.240 architect but not an Enterprise
48:21.359 architect how I can get on AA job do I
48:24.160 need to know the AA tools um Linux
48:27.280 aate so I think it's kind of repeating a
48:29.640 bit but I guess if and that's a we're
48:33.319 kind of coming coming closer to the end
48:36.040 um of the stream anyway it would be
48:37.720 really good guys that we kind of like
48:39.720 summarize what we talk about today and
48:42.599 if you give like your sort of top advice
48:45.680 of what would you recommend to someone
48:47.760 who want to move to Enterprise
48:50.400 architectural and you know with
48:52.200 summarizing everything we mentioned what
48:53.839 would be like your absolutely kind of
48:56.280 top
48:57.480 maybe Jack will will start with
49:00.079 you yeah um get used to running at two
49:03.559 speeds keep your technical skills sharp
49:06.400 do where whatever you're interested in
49:08.400 or passionate about research look it up
49:10.559 get your hands on it use it at the same
49:13.040 time also if you've got experts in your
49:15.640 business you must slow down and listen
49:17.440 to them you must trust them you must
49:19.319 work with your stakeholders you have to
49:21.240 build that credibility with them over
49:22.960 time so they trust you and your
49:24.839 technical skills that you put so much
49:26.160 work into building
49:29.400 100%
49:31.480 renala what how would you summarize your
49:34.079 top
49:35.480 advice yeah I think I think it would be
49:37.839 good to gain an Enterprise level
49:39.799 experience I think it's that's the
49:41.400 number one I think for me I learned more
49:43.359 on the Enterprise architecture by
49:46.319 learning on the experience and mentoring
49:48.920 by the Chief Architect as well so I got
49:51.160 a mentor as well who mentored me this is
49:54.079 how you be going to you know set up for
49:56.200 example a whole architecture for a whole
49:58.880 you know big company and that's where
50:00.680 you know and he was he's a CIO as well
50:03.599 and and and I got that very good
50:06.400 mentorship so I I can say find a good
50:08.559 Mentor probably that's a number one
50:10.280 second is you know develop your business
50:12.720 Acumen you know uh you know uh you know
50:15.680 learning about the business processes
50:18.079 it's not only you know the technology
50:20.319 but the business when I say businesses
50:21.880 the business processes you must
50:23.799 understand the financial management the
50:25.359 organizational strategy
50:27.359 you know these are pretty uh the the the
50:30.400 knowledge is very crucial for for
50:32.359 aligning so you need to understand all
50:34.240 these intricacy and I think it's very
50:37.920 important as well to have a network yeah
50:40.119 building your network and that's where
50:42.040 where where I I actually develop more of
50:44.359 it because I go to Gartner conferences I
50:47.319 go to different conferences I talk to
50:50.079 different guys and you know professional
50:52.319 associations and forums and then so th
50:55.079 those are the things so every day and I
50:56.920 remember I work for a company every week
50:58.799 we have new vendor coming in presenting
501.920 uh you know the new Tools in town or
504.119 about architecture or whatever industry
506.000 tends and emerging Technologies and
508.040 things like that so so I think th those
510.280 are the key points I think I can I can
512.319 say uh to to get into the Enterprise I
515.680 know achieving the Enterprise architect
517.400 role thank you 100% I'm I'm glad you
520.079 mentioned the men like having a mentor I
522.480 think we haven't really talked about it
524.920 um in this session but I I think have a
526.880 separate stream about how to find a
529.079 mentor and um we talk about few few
532.440 things guys if you're on this channel
534.480 you can scroll back and find that uh
536.799 find this episode because people always
539.400 willing to help because m is learning a
541.760 lot from being mentors as well so don't
544.839 be you know don't be shy to reach out to
547.000 people and you know if you reach out to
548.720 10 people and uh you know two say yes
552.559 like doesn't matter that eight say like
554.400 you know I mean like just don't don't
556.799 think about it just reach out and and
558.799 ask people and someone will tell yes and
52:00.920 someone will help you so it's just how
52:02.960 the bo works I guess um Alex and um over
52:06.760 do you anything to add to our
52:08.680 comprehensive list
52:10.720 of yeah be yeah like the others have
52:15.359 said I think um knowing where to
52:16.920 research is important so if you know
52:18.720 someone in your organization with a
52:20.319 gardener or infotech account or some
52:23.000 other resources I'm trying try and Hunt
52:25.839 that down we've they got access to the
52:27.640 architecture repository um hunt that
52:30.720 down and one of my golden rules for for
52:33.480 architecture is don't reinvent the wheel
52:36.000 usually you'll find someone's done some
52:37.880 work in in a space or if they're hav in
52:40.720 your organization someone either online
52:43.599 or with one of those research firms or
52:45.480 or whatever they've done a full analysis
52:47.720 so try and Hunt that down before you you
52:49.760 start wasting your time and build those
52:51.799 relationships with the with the smmes um
52:54.480 find out all the sort of ke capabilities
52:58.000 in your organization find out what they
52:59.839 do and especially in the it space um and
53:03.720 you chat with them and and see how much
53:06.000 you can pick their
53:08.359 brain definitely um Chan has a comment I
53:11.280 believe not only Architects should have
53:12.880 ownership and understanding of the
53:14.520 business but all individuals I totally
53:16.960 agree I think the every organization
53:19.880 will run so much better if only everyone
53:22.599 had a better understanding of the
53:25.160 business in general uh I think it's a
53:27.640 really good point especially for small
53:29.280 organization I think like in a small
53:31.119 organization if you only focus on your
53:33.400 task um and not like trying to
53:36.040 understand where the whole business is
53:37.480 going it's it's kind of like really hard
53:39.960 to move faster so I I think I totally
53:42.920 agree like that we we all also a really
53:46.119 good point there there's also a really
53:47.640 good point in that question for
53:49.240 Architects as well um which is that also
53:52.319 if if you are becoming an architect if
53:54.319 you're just starting your journey in
53:55.480 architecture keep in mind that this
53:56.799 field is complex it changes often give
53:59.599 yourself a little bit of space a little
54:01.359 bit of flexibility that that coming up
54:03.359 to speed on some of this stuff might
54:05.400 take time and that a particular design
54:07.559 or a particular solution you work on or
54:09.480 build it might not be perfect first time
54:11.119 because it is very complex
54:14.319 work yeah 100% we have a last question
54:17.280 so 30 seconds to answer this question
54:19.440 guys um from
54:21.359 Rakesh feel like a diff difficult
54:23.839 question how is Enterprise architecture
54:26.599 practices you organization is
54:29.160 measured Alex do you have answer oh we
54:32.760 recently did that so um the architecture
54:35.480 team have got a capability maturity
54:37.839 model with all the different domains in
54:40.920 architecture and they went around to all
54:43.000 the different it teams and The
54:44.400 Architects and measured it and produced
54:46.200 one of those web diagrams and some uh
54:49.240 you units are at level one some at level
54:51.319 two some at level three and yeah it was
54:53.799 a comprehensive activity but you might
54:55.799 want to search the internet for some
54:57.240 templates on architecture maturity
54:59.359 models or something similar and you'll
55:01.319 you you'll be able to measure it that
55:02.920 way yeah yeah perfect I'm I'm cautious
55:05.720 I'm cautious about the time we have five
55:07.559 minutes left of our Stream So the
55:09.640 exciting part of the stream is the the

00.240 Would you like to know why enterprise
02.080 architecture is so critical? If so, this
05.359 video is for you.
16.079 Hi, my name is Mike Gibbs. I'm an
18.080 enterprise architect with approximately
20.000 25 years experience. And in today's
23.039 video, we're going to talk about why
24.880 enterprise architecture is so critical.
28.080 We'll talk a bit about what is
29.760 enterprise architecture and why we do
31.679 what we do as enterprise architects. So
35.280 enterprise architecture is really about
38.320 strategic consulting
40.960 and it's a discipline that focuses on
43.280 aligning an organization's goals, the
45.840 way they do things and the technology
48.239 that powers that organization.
50.879 So it's a focus and it's a practice on
53.600 people, processes and technologies. And
56.000 what are we really trying to do? We're
58.480 trying to help the organization find the
000.399 most efficient way of doing things and
003.039 then figuring out what technology
004.879 systems will enable the organization's
006.960 customers to have the best experience
008.960 and users to do their jobs best.
012.799 So enterprise architecture is absolutely
015.920 critical because without tech enterprise
019.520 architecture what we have is technology
022.159 systems built by technologist based upon
024.560 what they think is important and
026.640 business goals and business
028.560 architectures designed by strategists
030.320 and often the technology does not
032.079 support the business.
034.880 Now I want you to think about it for a
037.200 second. What if someone else packed your
039.520 suitcase for you and they didn't know
041.439 where you wanted to go? They didn't know
043.759 whether you were going to be spending
044.720 the beach at Miami or visiting penguins
047.119 in Antarctica.
049.119 They didn't know if you had to prepare
050.640 for a board meeting in London, a party
053.439 in Nikko. So, you don't know if your
056.000 clothes would work, if you'd freeze to
057.520 death, if you'd burn and get a sunburn,
059.600 if you'd be protected by rain because
02:01.840 nobody knew where you were going.
02:04.960 Well, if we look that's what we've seen
02:06.960 in in organizations that don't have a
02:08.800 good strong enterprise architecture
02:10.318 practice. In fact, organizations without
02:12.640 strong enterprise architecture
02:14.080 practices, which are most 70 to 80% of
02:17.599 the time they put in new technology, it
02:19.840 does nothing for the business. But
02:22.319 imagine I have to be in a country. If
02:24.560 nobody knows which country I'm going to
02:25.840 be on my trip, they can't pack the right
02:27.760 clothes because they don't know if I'm
02:29.440 going to be in South Florida like I am
02:30.959 today where it's warm or two weeks ago
02:32.959 in Beverly Hills where I was freezing
02:35.040 and it was 60° Fahrenheit each day
02:37.280 versus the 85 degrees in my home in
02:39.280 Florida. But I knew where I was going so
02:41.680 I packed my clothes accordingly and that
02:43.280 way it was only a little cold. And
02:45.360 that's the reason enterprise
02:46.800 architecture is so essential. So how
02:49.920 does the enterprise architect do their
02:52.160 job? How do they align the
02:54.160 organization's people, processes, and
02:56.480 technology? Well, see, that all starts
02:58.640 with figuring out where you're going to
03:00.239 go. If you were going to pack a
03:01.360 suitcase, you need to know where the
03:02.560 traveler is going to go, right? So, the
03:04.640 first thing enterprise architecture
03:06.400 starts with the enterprise architect
03:08.319 learning the business goals, the
03:10.560 business current goals, its short-term
03:12.480 goals, and its long-term goals.
03:15.599 Now, that's going to be critical. Now,
03:17.040 the next thing the enterprise architect
03:18.560 would need to do or a good cloud
03:19.760 architect would do is examine the
03:21.599 business.
03:23.200 They'd look at the business
03:24.400 architecture. And here, when we're
03:26.239 looking at the business architecture,
03:28.000 we're going to map out the
03:29.040 organizational structure, the
03:31.120 organization's key processes or the way
03:33.040 they do things, the organization's value
03:35.920 streams or what creates value and what
03:37.840 that or organization's competitive
03:39.519 advantages and how they make their
03:40.720 money, so to speak.
03:43.280 And then when we know where we're going,
03:46.239 well then it's time for us architects to
03:48.720 barely map out the current technology
03:50.879 platform. Bring in a team of engineers,
03:53.120 for example, that will look at the data
03:54.560 flows, the data models, the data
03:56.560 governance that we have. Look at the
03:58.480 application architectures, the
03:59.920 applications that we have, their
04:01.360 portfolios, their integration patterns,
04:03.760 their life cycle management. And then
04:05.360 we'll evaluate the technology
04:06.720 architecture, whether it be things like
04:08.400 the compute or the storage or the
04:10.480 network or security or anything else
04:12.400 that goes along the way. And when we
04:15.040 know what we have and we know what we're
04:17.040 going now, it's a lot easier to pack a
04:19.120 suitcase. Mike's going to Palm Beach,
04:21.279 Brisbane, right? We know it's going to
04:23.120 be warm if it's the right time of year.
04:24.720 We know I'm probably going to go to the
04:26.000 beach. So now we know how to pick that
04:27.360 suitcase. Now we're in that same
04:28.880 situation for designing our enterprise
04:31.600 architectures. know this and now we get
04:33.520 into the design phase because now we
04:36.479 know the way the business should operate
04:38.160 or wants to operate and then we know
04:41.040 what our carrying technology platforms
04:43.120 are. So now it's just designing a
04:44.880 transition to go from where we are to
04:47.040 where we want to go and here's where the
04:49.759 architectural team will determine what
04:51.600 changes in processes need to occur as
04:54.639 well as what changes need to occur in
04:56.320 the technology systems to support those
04:58.880 people. And because nothing is ever
05:00.880 going to be perfect, I'm going to have
05:02.560 two choices. We're then going to have to
05:04.000 evaluate which choice is better for the
05:07.520 business when and when we make those
05:09.280 decisions. And that's why as enterprise
05:11.759 architects, after learning where we're
05:13.360 going and knowing what the technology is
05:16.080 and figuring out how to design the
05:17.840 technology, we've got to present it back
05:19.360 to the customer, get all their input,
05:21.280 and then uh tune the architecture and
05:23.440 present it back to the customer and get
05:25.360 more of their feedback. So we're in a
05:27.120 constant optimization process until we
05:30.000 finalize the architecture and know where
05:31.680 we need to go. Then we typically need to
05:33.919 create a governance strategy around it.
05:35.919 Some change control, some procedures,
05:37.440 some policies, what have you, etc. And
05:41.280 uh documentation of everything and
05:43.680 creation of architectural review boards.
05:45.440 Every time we want to make a change, how
05:46.720 we do it, making sure it's good for the
05:48.240 business
05:49.840 and uh all that is going to be, you
05:51.520 know, taking a lot of people in the
05:53.520 organization. and various stakeholders
05:55.120 will need to be there and it's going to
05:56.880 be a career of coordination. So you now
05:59.520 know that enterprise architecture is
06:00.960 essential to align the organization's
06:03.360 people, processes and technology. And
06:05.680 you can see that the enterprise
06:07.120 architect is functioning as a strategist
06:09.680 by evaluating the potential where the
06:12.000 company wants to go, the potential
06:13.520 processes to get there and the various
06:15.440 technology solutions that can do there
06:17.520 and facilitate and lead that
06:19.600 coordination between the business teams
06:21.759 that need that need to do their job and
06:23.840 the technology people. So effectively,
06:25.600 we're marrying them together to create a
06:27.680 cohesive strategy for that organization.
06:31.280 That is enterprise architecture. If
06:33.759 you'd like to become an enterprise
06:34.960 architect or maybe a cloud architect or

00.080 In this video, we're going to discuss
01.920 how to make the best cloud architecture
04.240 and enterprise architecture decisions.
16.160 Hi, my name is Michael Gibbs. I'm an
17.840 enterprise architect with about 25 years
20.000 experience in cloud architecture,
21.600 enterprise architecture, network
22.960 architecture, and security architecture.
25.279 And today's video we're going to talk
26.960 about making better decisions in your
29.599 cloud architecture and enterprise
31.279 architecture.
32.880 And uh the reason we have to talk about
35.360 decisionmaking in cloud architecture is
38.239 that in any architectural environment
41.680 there's never going to be a perfect
43.600 solution. It's just not going to happen.
46.079 There's always going to be some type of
47.760 a tradeoff.
49.440 And whether it's any process that we
51.440 choose to think about or any type of
53.760 technology we choose to think about,
55.840 there will always be a strength and a
58.559 weakness of every solution we come up
000.559 with. So that the key to a really great
003.199 cloud architecture or enterprise
004.720 architecture is not about picking the
006.560 coolest technology or the best
008.479 technology.
010.080 It's about aligning the people,
012.880 processes, and technology in the
015.200 organization. It's about picking a
017.680 technology strategy that's going to most
020.479 closely align with the organization's
022.400 goals.
023.920 That's the secret to making good
026.000 architectural decisions. And that's what
027.680 we're going to talk about. How to
029.200 evaluate architecture trade-offs in
031.920 cloud architecture and enterprise
033.200 architecture. So the first thing we're
036.240 going to talk about in order to do this
037.759 and to make good business decisions is
040.159 to clarify the business objectives. Now,
043.119 you would think this goes without
044.880 saying, but 70 plus% of all cloud
048.560 architectures and most technology
050.320 architectures in general provide zero, I
053.680 said it, zero business value. That means
056.720 they hurt the end business because they
058.640 take resources out of the company that
02:00.320 could be used for something else and
02:02.320 give the company nothing.
02:05.119 So, the first thing we need to think
02:06.960 about when evaluating trade-offs is how
02:09.119 do they align with the organization's
02:10.959 strategic goals?
02:14.080 If an organization is trying to get
02:16.000 faster and the technology can't help the
02:18.800 organization get faster and that's their
02:21.440 main goal, don't use it. No matter how
02:24.160 cool it is, it's not going to help. So,
02:26.879 we need to understand what we're trying
02:28.800 to do. Are we trying to be more agile?
02:30.879 Are we trying to reduce cost? Are we
02:32.879 trying to be the fastest or the best?
02:36.000 Are we trying to create a new
02:37.280 architecture for regulatory compliance
02:39.120 purposes? whatever it needs, we need to
02:42.640 make decisions and we need to evalify
02:45.680 them because if we're optimizing cost,
02:47.280 chances are we're not going to get the
02:48.640 greatest performance. So, we have to
02:51.120 evaluate these types of trade-offs. So,
02:54.319 the first thing we need to do is uh rank
02:57.200 any architectural options we have and we
03:00.720 need to rank them in terms of adherence
03:02.800 to the business goals. So, one thing
03:04.640 might be a 10 out of 10 on the business
03:06.400 goals and another thing might be a six
03:08.400 out of 10 towards meeting the business
03:09.760 goals, but we have to rank them. That's
03:12.080 really going to be the first step
03:13.519 anytime is look at our options and
03:15.280 figure out what's best for us. Now,
03:17.519 typically speaking, you know, I hate the
03:19.120 expression because I love cats, but
03:20.480 there's more than one way to skin a cat.
03:22.959 So, we typically have to identify
03:25.280 alternative solutions.
03:27.840 Maybe there's a different architectural
03:29.920 pattern we could choose. Maybe there's a
03:32.159 different technology we could choose.
03:33.519 Maybe there's a different framework that
03:35.280 would be better to our business.
03:38.080 So, here's where we're looking at our
03:40.239 alternatives.
03:42.080 And because, you know, we're looking at
03:44.319 alternatives, we have to evaluate what's
03:46.560 good about them. Now, personally, I like
03:48.879 to use a SWAT analysis. You know, the
03:51.040 strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
03:52.720 and threat uh analysis they typically
03:55.120 teach in MBA programs and they typically
03:57.519 use in the business world. And here's
03:59.040 the reason I typically you create some
04:02.159 type of a SWAT analysis of all the
04:03.840 alternative solutions. I can take that
04:06.159 to the organization stakeholders which
04:08.159 often are very familiar with how to use
04:09.840 a SWAT analysis. So that's typically
04:12.560 what I would do here. I would look at
04:14.159 the alternatives and I would look at all
04:15.680 their strengths and weaknesses and
04:16.959 opportunities and threats and how they
04:18.478 would that would relate to the business.
04:21.600 Now the next thing I really need to
04:23.120 think about is what is that organization
04:25.120 trying to deal with or trying to
04:27.120 achieve? about are they trying to uh
04:29.919 change their capital structure? Is it an
04:32.720 organization that's got a lot of debt on
04:34.560 the book that once they get rid of some
04:36.160 of the debt and then use a lease for
04:38.800 example which would make it go from
04:40.639 capex to opex or do they want to migrate
04:43.120 to the cloud because their capital
04:44.880 structure needs them to free up capital
04:46.400 and they'd prefer to move to an opex
04:48.160 environment what have you. So the first
04:49.759 thing we need to figure out is what's
04:50.880 best for the organization's capital
04:52.320 structure. Then we need to think about
04:54.800 performance, right? Because whether it's
04:56.720 going to be latency, throughput,
04:58.160 scalability, that's going to have a big
04:59.759 impact on many parts of our actual
05:01.759 system and the choices we make. Then we
05:04.320 need to think about the security and
05:06.639 compliance. You know, uh what's the
05:08.880 risk, what's the exposure, where's the
05:10.960 data, what are the requirements, those
05:12.639 kind of things. We need to think about
05:13.680 that in the constants of everything. And
05:15.919 typically, we need to think about the
05:17.680 maintainability of the solution. Look,
05:20.080 as cloud architects and enterprise
05:21.520 architects, we're not going to build it,
05:23.039 but somebody's going to have to build
05:24.320 this and maintain it. So, we need to
05:26.560 make sure they can manage it and that
05:28.160 it's not too operationally complex and
05:30.560 that there's a reasonable support model
05:32.400 and things that are there to make that
05:33.759 happen. And there's even tools to enable
05:35.280 the people to manage it.
05:37.919 We might be looking for time to market
05:39.680 and maybe time to market demands a cloud
05:41.840 computing environment that might cost
05:43.280 three times more than the data center
05:44.720 environment. But if time to market is
05:46.560 the thing that matters, maybe that's a
05:48.080 trade worth making.
05:50.800 We need to think about the flexibility
05:52.800 of any architecture. For example, is it
05:55.600 flexible that enables easy changes? Is
05:57.520 it optimized for what we need to do? And
05:59.280 we always need to think about it. So,
06:01.600 you know, as we started going through,
06:03.520 we were looking at the business
06:04.639 objectives and then we were looking at
06:06.639 alternative solutions. And now we're
06:08.720 really really defining our evaluation
06:11.199 criteria.
06:12.800 Now, once we start going here, now we're
06:14.400 in a much better position to really
06:15.759 think about our decisions. We can start
06:18.000 quantifying impacts. We can create ROI
06:20.319 projections and total cost of ownership
06:22.080 models. And that way, we've got a
06:24.479 financial numbers numbers where we can
06:26.560 do an apples to apples comparison
06:28.319 between different architectural choices.
06:32.240 Now the next thing we need to do is once
06:34.319 we've got our thoughts and we've got
06:35.680 this is really about meeting with
06:37.120 stakeholders and giving them the chance
06:38.639 to say I like this. I don't like this.
06:42.240 This is going to help me more than this.
06:45.120 Because that then puts us in the
06:46.720 position to be going back. We've done
06:48.880 the analysis. We've done our planning
06:50.400 and now we're getting feedback on it
06:51.759 from the people that know the company
06:53.039 the best.
06:55.199 Now at this time we we can look through
06:57.520 various scenarios and simulate a best
06:59.919 case scenario, a worst case scenario,
07:02.000 how it most likely will be used, the
07:04.240 effectiveness, and that's really what
07:06.479 goes into it. So once we've got all
07:08.720 that, now we've got some decisions to
07:10.479 make. We can assess risk. We can assess
07:13.199 mitigations. We can assess which
07:14.720 technology or solution gets us closer to
07:16.560 the goals, closer to the strategic
07:18.880 initiatives. Now we think we've got a
07:20.880 solution. Now at this point we might
07:22.800 bring in a proof of concept. Now here as
07:25.360 a cloud architect or an enterprise
07:26.720 architect we're going to lean it lead
07:28.240 this proof of concept. We're going to
07:29.599 design the proof of concept design
07:31.599 success criteras what have you and then
07:33.680 bring in some engineers to build it and
07:35.280 then we will measure it. We'll measure
07:37.759 the performance the integration effort
07:39.919 get user feedback and see if it did what
07:41.759 was designed. And then at that point
07:43.759 then we need to start thinking about if
07:45.280 it's right for the business and then
07:46.479 figuring out how to get the culture to
07:47.840 change what have you. But that's how you
07:50.080 make architectural decisions.
07:52.479 Notice not an easy process. We really
07:55.039 have to evaluate everything going back
07:56.800 to the business. Uh going back to the
07:59.520 goals, going back to the alternative
08:01.360 solutions and what they can each do
08:02.879 compared to each other, the strengths
08:04.639 and weaknesses of every possible choice,
08:07.280 the impact to the business,
08:09.919 the stakeholder feedback stage for the
08:12.080 most part, and then the proof of
08:14.160 concept, and then tuning to make it best
08:16.000 for the client. This is how you make
08:17.919 better decisions in cloud architecture
08:19.759 and enterprise architecture. Now, if
08:22.160 you'd like to become a cloud architect,

00.000 Would you like to learn about business
01.760 continuity planning and disaster
03.439 recovery planning? If so, this video is
05.839 for you.
16.640 Hi, my name is Mike Gibbs. I'm the CEO
18.720 of GoCloud Careers and an enterprise
20.560 architect with over 25 years experience.
22.960 And I find many new architects, new
25.279 solutions architects, new cloud
26.640 architects really struggle to learn
28.800 business continuity planning, disaster
30.720 recovery planning and typically get
32.238 confused between the two. So we are
34.800 going to discuss what is business
36.719 continuity planning and disaster
38.480 recovery planning. We will discuss the
41.600 differences between them. We will
42.960 discuss maximum tolerable downtime and
45.040 the concepts behind it. Then we will get
47.039 into RTO and RPO and where that actually
50.399 comes from. Reco recovery time
51.920 objectives and recovery point
53.280 objectives. So before we compare and
56.640 contrast these, let's talk about what is
58.719 business continuity planning all about.
001.920 Now business continuity planning is
003.760 typically a strategic process that an
006.000 organization will use to make sure they
008.479 can continue critical operations during
011.840 downtime. So or challenges or major
014.960 disasters. So how would we keep a
017.040 hospital up and running inclusive of the
020.640 people and everything else in that
022.400 hospital goes into say business
024.159 continuity planning. Now the goal here
027.600 is to minimize any kind of disruptions
030.560 after a major disruption like an
032.560 earthquake or a hurricane or something
035.759 big to recover critical functions and
038.400 quickly recover from these disruptions
040.159 as fast as necessary for the business's
042.560 need. So when we talk about business
044.640 continuity planning the scope is
046.560 anything that would go you would think
047.600 in a cloud architecture enterprise
049.040 architecture people processes technology
052.799 and building and it's going to involve a
054.880 lot of it we may need to operate in a
056.960 different building we may need to change
058.399 the various business processes we need
059.920 certain technology to come up so that's
02:02.000 what's going to be part of what's
02:03.520 necessary it's going to address all
02:05.200 operational all IT communications and
02:08.959 everything that goes into business
02:10.318 continuity planning now how do we plan
02:12.879 this? How do we determine what kind of
02:14.720 things we need to do? Well, what we
02:16.640 typically have to do is something called
02:18.000 the business impact analysis. And what's
02:20.560 going to go into that is going to help
02:23.280 us first identify what are the key
02:25.520 critical processes that must happen
02:27.920 under all circumstances and also assess
02:31.120 the impact of a disruption to one of
02:33.280 those processes. So we have to assess
02:35.280 that. Now when we understand what needs
02:37.920 to run versus what not doesn't need to
02:40.319 run then we can prioritize recovery e
02:43.120 efforts. So a hospital for example may
02:45.120 have to take care of their patients
02:46.239 first before they worry about other
02:48.400 certain things going on. Now what we
02:51.120 have to determine as part of the
02:52.640 business impact analysis is something
02:54.480 called maximum tolerable downtime.
02:57.920 Now the maximum tolerable downtime is
03:00.400 the maximum amount of time that the
03:02.319 business can be down before suffering
03:04.959 irreparable unreoverable losses. So when
03:08.800 we start talking about recovery time
03:11.519 objective later, the recovery time
03:14.400 objective has to be less than the
03:16.560 maximum tolerable downtime because if
03:18.319 the business is going to be done forever
03:21.280 damaged after four hours is downtime,
03:23.280 then we need to get that system up prior
03:25.120 to four hours. I hope that makes sense.
03:27.840 So realistically speaking, part of that
03:30.080 business impact analysis is going to be
03:31.760 a risk assessment where we're going to
03:33.760 evaluate various threats and their
03:35.760 likelihood, whether they be natural,
03:37.599 technological, human, or other words.
03:40.239 And then we're going to be coming up
03:41.519 with a recovery strategy based upon that
03:44.159 maximum tolerable downtime. Again, total
03:47.280 business operations is business
03:49.120 continuity planning or at least the
03:50.560 essential business operations. Now,
03:52.799 let's talk about what disaster recovery
03:54.959 planning is. This is a little different
03:56.400 than business continuity planning,
03:57.920 although it's a subset of business
03:59.360 continuity planning. Disaster recovery
04:02.159 planning is more of a formalized
04:03.840 strategy and a set of procedures for
04:06.080 restoring the tech or the IT systems and
04:08.720 the data and the infrastructure after a
04:11.439 disruptive event. Now, that could be a
04:13.120 natural disaster like a hurricane. It
04:15.040 could potentially be a hacking event,
04:17.120 too. So, with disaster recovery
04:20.160 planning, it's about the tech and
04:21.918 getting the tech up and operational. So
04:24.320 what do we need to do from a disaster
04:26.000 recovery planning perspective? First we
04:28.320 need to obviously understand the
04:29.840 business and its business needs. We need
04:31.520 to understand maximum tolerable downtime
04:34.000 from the business impact analysis from
04:35.919 business continuity planning. And now we
04:38.320 need to catal catalog what we have. We
04:40.560 need an inventory of all the critical
04:42.320 systems. We need an inventory of all the
04:44.479 critical applications, databases,
04:46.320 network, compute, what have you. Because
04:48.240 we can't figure out a plan to protect it
04:50.160 unless we know exactly what we're
04:51.600 protecting. And now we'd set our
04:53.440 recovery time objective which is has to
04:55.759 be less than the maximum tolerable
04:57.199 downtime or how much downtime we can
04:59.120 tolerate. And then we come up with our
05:01.360 recovery point objective which is the
05:03.040 maximum amount of data loss we can use.
05:05.520 So if a business can tolerate 2 hours of
05:08.000 data loss, their RPO has to be less than
05:10.479 two hours. And we only know that after
05:12.880 we understand the business and the
05:14.400 business's needs. And what can happen?
05:16.240 Imagine a company the size of Amazon
05:18.000 that had two hours of lost orders. that
05:20.800 could be pretty significant. For other
05:22.479 businesses, it could be small. So, when
05:25.199 we also set up our disaster recovery
05:27.440 planning, we typically think of backup
05:29.120 strategies. How frequently back up, the
05:31.280 type of backup we use. Do we back up on
05:34.080 cloud? Do we use a cloud disaster
05:35.759 recovery environment? Do we have an
05:37.360 additional disaster recovery environment
05:38.960 that we can run on our own? We have to
05:41.360 think about our data and its replication
05:43.600 and the options that we actually choose.
05:46.560 and uh how we choose these options will
05:48.880 determine how fast our systems actually
05:50.960 come back. Now, when we think about
05:53.199 disaster recovery planning, it's not
05:54.720 just about the tech. We need to clearly
05:56.560 define roles and responsibilities for
05:58.479 the people on the disaster recovery team
06:00.400 and what they will typically do. And
06:02.639 typically speaking, as architects, we
06:04.479 help organizations come up with runbooks
06:06.560 and playbooks, which are more of a
06:08.160 step-by-step instruction for how you
06:10.720 would bring things back, how you would
06:13.199 communicate events or how you would
06:14.800 escalate events in a real challenging
06:17.360 environment. So, I talked a little bit
06:19.520 about RTO and RPO, but I want to get a
06:22.000 little more de into the recovery time
06:24.639 objective and the recovery point
06:26.080 objective. So if we go back to RTO now,
06:28.800 that's going to be the maximum amount of
06:30.400 downtime that a business can actually
06:32.639 handle. So business has to be up in two
06:35.120 hours. The RTO is 2 hours. Now obviously
06:39.520 this is fairly strategic because we're
06:42.080 looking at what the business can
06:44.000 actually tolerate, how fast we need to
06:46.080 get systems up.
06:48.319 So this will determine the strategy. For
06:51.840 example, we could run a warm standby in
06:54.240 a cloud environment where we've got
06:55.919 small versions of what we have in our
06:58.000 data center in the cloud. And should
07:00.000 something happened to our cloud within
07:01.440 45 minutes, that cloud environment can
07:03.199 be up and running at full capacity,
07:06.080 which is great, but what if the business
07:07.840 needs to be up and running in 5 minutes?
07:10.000 Then we might need to have an identical
07:11.919 replication of what we have in our data
07:13.599 center in another data center or a cloud
07:15.360 provider. So, we have to think about it
07:17.039 from a cost perspective. The shorter the
07:19.680 return rec recovery time objective, the
07:22.080 more expensive it's going to get. So,
07:24.319 you're typically going to see very short
07:26.000 recovery time objectives on uh say big
07:29.120 banks where there's lots of financial
07:30.800 transactions or anything where there's a
07:32.479 lot of money or life going through it.
07:35.120 Hospital have to get that up and running
07:36.639 fairly quickly. Now, lower recovery time
07:39.599 objectives typically get much less
07:41.840 expensive, reduce operational costs
07:43.919 dramatically because you'll need less
07:45.919 people to make these work. Now let's get
07:47.759 to that recovery point objective. And
07:49.280 realistically speaking, it's the maximum
07:51.120 amount of data loss that an organization
07:53.520 can actually have. Could it be 10
07:55.520 minutes, 15 minutes, four hours? It's
07:57.039 all based upon the business. And again,
07:59.280 this is strategic. This is a strategic
08:01.199 implementation implication because if we
08:03.440 can only tolerate two hours of lost
08:05.919 data, we've got to back up at least
08:07.440 every two hours or replicate our data at
08:09.840 least every two hours. So obviously what
08:13.360 we need to do, the amount of data we
08:15.039 lose has a significant impact on our
08:17.360 cloud architecture or entered
08:19.039 architecture and how we actually do our
08:20.720 backup strategies and the types of
08:22.800 strategies behind that. So in this video
08:25.840 we really talked about the difference
08:27.759 between business continuity planning,
08:29.440 disaster recovery planning, RTO, RPO and
08:33.200 we discussed the concept of maximum
08:34.880 tolerable downtime. Now, if you're
08:36.640 looking to become a cloud architect, an
08:38.320 enterprise architect, an AI architect, a
08:40.640 security architect, not only do we have

00.200 Would you like to know what
01.666 is an enterprise architect and what does an enterprise architect do?
05.566 If so, this video is for you.
17.566 Hi, my name is mike gibbs and I'm the CEO of Go Careers
20.633 and I've been all kinds of i.t architects for the last 25 years.
24.233 Network architects, business architects, enterprise architects.
27.566 And I've loved every architect career, but the enterprise architect
31.366 is my absolute favorite.
33.316 So what is an enterprise architect?
35.933 We first have to understand that the enterprise architect is a business
39.466 executive with good, strong foundations in technology.
43.850 The Enterprise architect is, realistically speaking, the most strategic
47.400 of all technology careers,
48.716 because the enterprise architect is tasked with aligning the organization's people,
53.450 business processes and technology
56.150 in a manner that optimizes the client's business performance.
59.366 Now, the enterprise architect is an executive role,
002.000 and it has so many names that it causes a lot of confusion with people.
006.016 Some organizations call us enterprise architects.
008.666 Enterprise architects.
010.250 There are other roles where we're called the chief architect.
012.900 In other cases, we're called the chief technology officer.
016.583 And because the enterprise architect role is a big role
020.250 and it requires very strong business acumen, leadership skills,
024.200 executive communication skills, presentation skills, sales skills
027.650 and many other executive skills.
030.533 It tends to pay very well, and it's not uncommon to see enterprise
034.583 architect roles in the 200000 to $800000 per year range, at least in the US.
040.516 Now the enterprise architect is not a techie role,
043.066 it's not a hands on role, it is a leadership and planning role
047.816 and we enterprise architects really focusing
050.116 on optimizing the organizations and how they do business
054.383 and better leveraging technology to optimize their business performance.
058.400 So what do we actually do?

059.816 What does an enterprise architect do?
02:02.116 Well, it's all about aligning the people processes in technology.
02:05.850 So how do we do that?
02:07.966 Well, we have to work with the executive team
02:10.500 of our clients so we can find a vision of their business.
02:14.416 Where do they want to take their business now?
02:16.350 Three months from now, six months from now, a year from now,
02:18.800 five years from now, ten years from now, 20 years from now,
02:21.983 as our architectures have to be able to support that type of growth.
02:25.966 Now, the next thing an enterprise architect really needs to do
02:29.366 is really go in there and understand that business,
02:33.200 everything from the org chart to the key business processes.
02:36.716 For example, how is a product made?
02:38.366 How's customer service delivered?
02:39.866 How does the supply chain work?
02:42.000 How is the sales process?
02:43.316 We have to understand all of it
02:45.016 and we have to do this
02:46.216 because any time we put technology and it can either optimize
02:49.350 the way that works, but to disrupt in a negative impact how that works.
02:52.400 So to be successful,
02:54.200 we've got to go learn that business before we think about anything else.
02:58.350 Now, when
02:58.650 we think about that business, along with the client's executive team
03:01.733 and to some degree some of their technical professionals,
03:03.900 at least their leadership based professionals, we have to see
03:07.283 does the client's vision and the current way they do business work
03:11.183 or do we have to change the way they want to do business?
03:14.366 For example, let's say we had a global retailer
03:16.966 and they had an e-commerce website.
03:19.133 Currently a customer goes to the client, they buy what they want and sold.
03:23.300 But if, for example, we wanted that website to have a recommendation engine.
03:27.166 So for example, I went there and bought cat food,
03:30.466 maybe suggest maybe you'd like to buy cat treats while you're here shopping.
03:33.650 That would be a recommendation engine that typically driven by A.I.
03:37.016 that changes the way their business operates.
03:39.150 So if we wanted a recommendation engine,
03:41.366 we have to think about how that will work and then we have to
03:43.733 think about the technologies that would enable us to get there.
03:46.650 So we know we have to understand the current processes
03:49.550 and then re-architect them with the client and make sure they work for the client.
03:53.866 Now, the next thing the enterprise architect has to do
03:56.216 is we have to evaluate our client's technology.
03:59.666 What is their network look like?
04:01.016 What is their security look like? What does their data center look like?
04:03.533 What is their cloud look like?
04:04.733 What are their applications look like? What are the security look like?
04:07.516 What's their voice and video system?
04:09.300 We have to look at all of it.
04:11.066 That big picture overview and we have to see
04:14.966 with the current technology that we have will get that business to be able
04:18.983 to have its new business processes and achieve its future business goals.
04:22.250 And if the answer is yes,
04:23.716 we're going to work on a new project
04:25.100 because there's nothing for us to re-architect.
04:27.716 But in most cases of a client wants to do business a different way,
04:31.466 they're going to have a lot of changes
04:33.050 that need to occur specifically in the technology space. So
04:37.283 we will look at their current technology,
04:39.200 then we will look at the new business goals
04:41.516 and we will evaluate the current technology.
04:43.850 What's working, what's not working was performing optimally.
04:47.250 And then we'll think if that gets to the client, to the goals, and if it won't,
04:50.600 then we have to create a new architecture, a new technology
04:53.933 blueprint to get to those business processes and key business goals.
04:59.000 No text
04:59.066 So how do we do that?
05:00.566 You know, an architect isn't going to go out there and code or configure.
05:03.266 We don't build things as architects.
05:04.650 We have to lead and we have to strategize.
05:07.166 So when we know what's going to be necessary to be done,
05:09.833 we have to bring in a team of professionals.
05:13.050 We will lead a team of architect, for example, from a cloud architect.
05:15.900 I'm an enterprise architect.
05:17.416 I may have a cloud architect working for me, some solutions architect
05:20.433 from various vendors working with me.
05:22.316 I may have some I architect some I engineer, some data scientist.
05:26.816 For example, in this team
05:28.583 I may have a network architect, I may have some network engineers,
05:31.433 I may have an application architect, I may have some software developers.
05:34.883 And it's going to be a big team if we're dealing with big enterprises
05:37.733 because they're going to have a lot of technology needs.
05:39.716 And it's not going to be so simple as just change one thing
05:42.050 and everything is going to fall into place. It's going to be a big role.
05:44.516 We're going to have to think about all this and how those parts fit together
05:48.000 and then will lead that architectural team to design it.
05:52.950 And now that we've got a proposed architecture, we've got to go presented
05:56.966 back to the client and its key stakeholders,
05:59.566 see if it's going to work for the organization.
06:01.466 Is it going to work for their business? Can they support the technology?
06:04.200 Do they have the readiness to support that technology?
06:06.500 The people in place that can do it?
06:08.516 So we have to assess that organization's readiness for change will ultimately
06:12.083 have to create a statement of work
06:13.733 along with architectural blueprints for the client.
06:16.916 So that needs what needs to be done.
06:19.166 We will have to help create a governing structure of the leadership people
06:22.650 that will govern the implementation of the new systems.
06:25.883 We even as enterprise architects, will create a framework for change
06:29.400 like a change management framework.
06:31.200 If something we need it to occur, who needs to know about it?
06:33.800 Who needs to approve, etc.?
06:35.100 What's necessary to make sure we make changes
06:37.316 and the least impactful, negatively impactful way to the client.
06:40.000 No text
06:40.916 What are some other things we do?
06:42.750 Well, in many cases, we have to sell the solutions to clients.
06:45.800 We do a lot of relationship management and vendor management, both relationship
06:49.616 with people on the team, our teams, our client teams with vendors.
06:53.266 We give presentations on a constant basis both to our clients,
06:57.266 to our clients executives, sometimes to our clients, more technical teams.
07:00.866 We present at conferences like industry conferences,
07:04.016 we present an executive briefings of a company
07:06.266 you say work for a cloud provider or another technology provider,
07:09.616 and they fly all their executives in to meet some of your executives
07:12.800 and leaders and architects you'll be presenting there.
07:15.350 And of course, you know, we're constantly involved
07:18.416 in doing anything we can to improve that business, to improve our clients.
07:22.166 So now, you know,
07:22.966 what is an enterprise architect and what does an enterprise architect do?
07:26.866 And I have to tell you,
07:27.750 after being an architect for 25 years, this is one of my favorite roles.
07:30.750 I absolutely love it. It's fantastic role.
07:33.950 Now, if you'd like to become an enterprise architect or a cloud architect

01.079 hi I'm Chris mler fractional CTO from
04.400 virtual elephant Consulting and in this
07.200 video we are going to Deep dive into how
09.920 to set up an Enterprise architecture or
12.799 EA practice within your
15.279 organizations as a CTO CIO or other
18.840 senior leader you know how crucial it is
21.680 to be able to formulate your strategy
24.160 and then be able to have a practice in
26.000 place to execute it in this video I'm
28.920 going to review with you the 10-step
30.800 process to setting up an EA practice
33.800 within your
35.000 organizations let's get
38.530 [Music]
46.960 started as we dive into the 10-step
49.960 process for an establishing an
51.640 Enterprise architecture practice within
53.760 your organizations it's going to be
56.280 crucial on you as a senior leader CTO or
59.600 c IO to be able to articulate out to
002.640 your stakeholders why it is going to be
004.640 so crucial from a business perspective
007.720 and when we think about establishing an
009.479 EA practice within our organizations
012.119 there are really three key benefits that
014.000 we typically key in on the first is the
017.119 ability to improve our decision-making
019.400 process across our organizations both
022.119 between our it and our engineering teams
025.759 second we want to be able to optimize
028.040 our it and Cloud assets
030.520 and having a structured EA practice
032.920 should help you accomplish just that and
035.560 then finally we want to make sure that
037.240 we are able to enhance our business
039.479 agility again everything comes down to
042.159 being able to execute and that's what
044.439 we're going to be judged on that's how
046.520 we're going to be able to determine our
048.119 Roi within our investments for all of
051.439 these digital transformation initiatives
053.520 that we're trying to undertake in 2024
056.640 and Beyond the first step is establish
02:00.039 in a Clear Vision and purpose as a CTO
02:03.600 or CIO I want to make sure that I'm
02:06.079 establishing what my vision is and why I
02:09.199 want to be creating an EA practice
02:11.640 within our
02:13.000 organizations the reality is the vast
02:15.959 majority of digital transformation and
02:18.120 Cloud transformation projects that we as
02:20.560 CTO and cios undertake fail because we
02:24.560 lack the ability to be able to establish
02:26.800 Frameworks within our organizations to
02:29.120 be able to Greenline our success and the
02:31.920 key thing about establishing an EA
02:33.800 practice is that it's going to help us
02:35.840 be able to marry the vision that we've
02:37.599 set forth within our digital
02:39.319 Transformations and bring it together
02:41.360 with the Strategic implementation of
02:43.519 those initiatives within our
02:45.760 organizations and so we want to be able
02:47.680 to establish an EA practice to be able
02:49.599 to bring together both our engineering
02:51.760 and our it assets stakeholders and team
02:54.519 members to be able to work towards a
02:56.440 common goal and that's what we want to
02:58.360 set forth here in Step One one now step
03:01.599 two is making sure that we have
03:03.400 executive sponsorship and buyin and this
03:06.400 is going to be so crucial because often
03:08.640 times when we do not have that executive
03:11.400 sponsorship that we need either from our
03:13.640 CEO or from our board of directors it's
03:16.680 going to Doom an initiative from the
03:18.400 Geto and so making sure that we have
03:20.840 that executive sponsorship is going to
03:23.239 help our EA board and our board members
03:26.959 that we establish within that board be
03:29.280 able to make sure that they are working
03:30.959 towards a common set of goals that are
03:32.799 in alignment with all of the business
03:34.840 strategic objectives and this is going
03:37.280 to help us make sure that in the long
03:39.159 term that we are going to be successful
03:42.040 again as I've talked about before one of
03:44.360 the things that we need to make sure
03:45.480 that we're doing as CTO and cios is that
03:48.480 we have a vision that's going to stretch
03:50.439 out multiple years and any digital
03:53.480 transformation project really is going
03:55.760 to take anywhere between 3 and 5 years
03:58.319 and you've heard me say this before
04:00.360 and one of the things that we want to
04:01.640 make sure that we do from the beginning
04:03.079 is establish this EA practice to be able
04:05.799 to enhance our chances to be able to
04:07.560 enhance our ability to succeed within
04:10.000 our digital transformation
04:12.519 initiatives so now that we've set a
04:14.799 Clear Vision and we've gotten Buy in
04:16.918 from our stakeholders step three is
04:19.560 really about defining and choosing an EA
04:22.440 framework and methodology that we're
04:24.199 going to adopt now I personally
04:26.759 recommend togaf and while there are
04:28.440 others out there I I have found
04:30.320 personally that toggaf works for the
04:32.199 vast majority of organizations that I've
04:34.039 worked with over the last five or six
04:35.960 years now one of the critical aspects of
04:38.680 adopting any framework within our
04:40.880 organizations is that we make sure that
04:42.800 we customize it for our use cases and so
04:46.039 taking a framework like like toggaf is
04:48.960 going to enable us and allow us to be
04:51.120 able to customize it based on our needs
04:53.759 and how our organization is set up but
04:57.039 choosing a framework from the get-go
04:59.160 getting everyone in alignment with what
05:01.479 framework we're going with and certainly
05:03.680 making sure that we are enabling our
05:05.280 team members especially our EA board
05:07.400 members to be able to have fluency
05:09.800 within what that framework prescribes
05:12.320 and the different processes and steps
05:14.360 that it's going to set forth for us is
05:16.680 crucial so once we've chosen this we
05:19.080 want to make sure that we go through and
05:20.520 we enable all of our team members that
05:22.800 are going to be part of our EA practice
05:25.759 and so step four is all about
05:28.120 establishing an EA road map now this is
05:31.280 going to be all about what our future
05:33.479 state vision is going to look like what
05:35.880 do we want our architecture to look like
05:37.680 how do we want our applications to be
05:39.680 refactored what are we trying to get to
05:42.600 in the long term from a digital or Cloud
05:45.160 transformation perspective and so the
05:47.639 first thing that we need to do and I
05:50.080 talked about this last week in my video
05:52.880 is we need to be able to perform a
05:54.960 maturity assessment we need to
05:57.520 understand both from a cloud
05:58.880 infrastructure perspective as well as
06:01.120 from an in an engineering and an
06:03.120 application perspective where we are
06:05.319 today we need to be able to identify our
06:07.800 strengths our weaknesses and our
06:11.080 opportunities and once we've gone
06:12.919 through this assessment then it's going
06:14.880 to be time for us to start looking at
06:17.400 what our current action items are going
06:19.160 to be what areas do we want to focus on
06:22.199 and how we are going to create our
06:23.919 future State architecture and this is
06:26.360 where our Architects our application our
06:29.319 dat data our system our infrastructure
06:31.960 and our Cloud Architects are all going
06:34.240 to work together with our Enterprise
06:36.120 architect and be able to come up with
06:38.440 the long-term future State architecture
06:41.160 that we're going to be driving towards
06:43.120 as an organization as part of our
06:45.240 digital transformation now that we've
06:47.680 created our assessment and we understand
06:49.520 where we are and we believe we have an
06:52.240 understanding of where we want to go
06:53.680 with our future State architecture the
06:55.919 next part that we need to do is now
06:57.560 we're going to form our e a team and as
07:00.840 I mentioned just a moment ago this is
07:03.080 going to include individuals such as our
07:05.039 Solutions our data our application our
07:08.440 cloud and art infrastructure Architects
07:11.039 and we're going to bring them all
07:12.520 together and we're going to come up with
07:14.400 this long-term future State architecture
07:16.599 that we want to create and each
07:18.840 architect that is part of our EA team is
07:21.560 going to work together within the
07:23.160 boundaries of their subject matter
07:25.000 expertise to be able to help us come up
07:27.479 with a solution and a long-term term
07:29.800 design that is robust that's aligned to
07:33.240 our business objectives and that we've
07:35.520 done our due diligence to gather all of
07:37.759 our requirements our constraints and
07:40.039 where we've identified our risks and
07:41.879 figured out what we are going to do to
07:43.840 mitigate those risks in the long term so
07:46.599 that we can be successful within this
07:48.599 digital transformation that we're
07:50.919 undergoing and our role as senior
07:53.759 leaders as CTO and cios now is support
07:58.520 we need to be supporting our EA team to
08:01.599 make sure that they have both the time
08:03.960 and the resources that they need to be
08:06.400 able to go out and accomplish this work
08:08.879 to help us be able to realize and marry
08:11.800 the vision that we've come up with with
08:14.199 the Strategic intent and the actual
08:16.560 deliverables of a cloud and application
08:19.080 architecture that's going to meet the
08:20.879 needs of our business long term now step
08:24.479 six our team has started working on the
08:26.759 design and so now what we need to do is
08:28.680 we need to EST establish and create re
08:31.039 EA tools and repositories that the team
08:33.399 is going to leverage as they work on
08:35.000 this future State architecture and so
08:37.479 depending on your organization this is
08:39.080 where a lot of customization is going to
08:41.120 come into play you might already have
08:43.399 existing tools that you've leveraged in
08:45.680 the past for backing up and for storing
08:49.440 your artifact data as part of this EA
08:52.040 framework that we're now going to
08:53.760 establish so if you already have these
08:56.240 tools go ahead and keep leveraging them
08:58.360 if you don't have these tools and this
09:00.000 is all new to you this is where you're
09:02.160 going to have your EA team come up with
09:04.480 the tools that they think that they're
09:05.959 going to need to be able to accomplish
09:08.079 the task at hand now again as with
09:10.839 everything else when we're choosing
09:12.839 these tools we want to be quick to be
09:14.680 able to make decisions we don't want to
09:16.519 drag out long-term evaluations we want
09:20.240 to pick a tool see if it works for us
09:22.640 and if it doesn't adapt later on we can
09:26.200 always abandon a tool later on and
09:28.320 replace it with something else but here
09:30.600 as we're establishing this framework for
09:32.320 the first time we want to make sure that
09:33.760 we don't get into analysis paralysis and
09:36.760 we want to make sure that we're actually
09:38.200 executing in a quick timeline to be able
09:40.839 to establish this practice so that we
09:42.560 can just start getting working and start
09:44.880 getting into the meat of everything that
09:46.800 we want to do this is one of the areas
09:49.399 where many organizations get bogged down
09:52.040 they get so hyperfocused on picking the
09:54.399 right tool they decide and they go past
09:57.160 the tool that is good enough for now and
09:59.519 that's one of the things that I've
10:00.519 learned we want to make sure that when
10:01.640 we're choosing tools we're not looking
10:03.920 for the perfect tool I'll be honest with
10:06.399 you it doesn't exist and so we want to
10:08.880 make make sure that we pick a tool that
10:10.880 meets our base requirements to be able
10:12.680 to leverage within our organizations and
10:14.760 within our EA framework to make sure
10:16.920 that we actually get to doing the actual
10:18.560 work that's important because remember
10:20.640 picking a tool ultimately isn't going to
10:23.519 be the thing that determines our success
10:25.760 long term from a digital transformation
10:28.040 perspective so so step seven now this is
10:30.800 all about engagement and communication
10:33.440 so we want to make sure that our EA
10:35.200 board and our EA team that they're
10:37.560 engaging our stakeholders and that
10:39.279 they're communicating what they're doing
10:40.959 back to the board so as the EA team is
10:44.320 working and executing against the tasks
10:46.680 that we set before them as an EA board
10:48.959 as a CTO or CIO we want to make sure
10:51.720 that they're going back and they're
10:52.880 regularly communicating back to the
10:54.800 board what they're doing what they've
10:56.600 accomplished where they're struggling
10:58.600 what road block
10:59.920 might they have encountered and we want
101.839 to make sure that they're regularly
103.279 talking to both the board and the
104.519 stakeholders to make sure that everyone
106.560 stays in alignment with what we're
108.000 working on it's going to be crucial that
110.399 we overly communicate especially early
112.959 on as we're trying to show the value of
115.760 establishing this EA practice within our
118.880 organizations and the more that we
120.839 communicate the more engaged our
123.000 stakeholders are going to feel and
125.040 longterm that's ultimately going to help
127.160 us with our success
129.360 now step eight is all about governance
131.680 and setting standards now any good
134.320 Enterprise architecture framework like
136.440 togaf is going to help us be able to
138.480 Define what the governance model is
140.200 going to look like and when we think
142.519 back around the earlier videos and
144.360 Concepts that I've talked about around
145.920 the cloud operating model you'll know
148.399 how importance governance is from a
150.360 cloud operating model perspective and so
153.279 our EA practice and its governance that
155.839 we set forth within it needs to align
158.639 with what we're doing doing within our
159.959 Cloud operating model all of these
12:02.440 things are ultimately going to work
12:04.079 together to help us be successful with
12:06.079 our digital transformation initiatives
12:08.760 now this governance model can take many
12:10.720 forms and it's going to be customized
12:13.360 based off of what our business is and
12:15.399 the areas in which we operate but it's
12:17.959 going to be important that we make sure
12:19.279 that we apply the governance to all of
12:21.079 our EA projects that come through the EA
12:24.320 board and this EA practice that we're
12:26.639 establishing and that's going to help us
12:28.720 make sure that were successful long term
12:31.160 the more standardization that we can put
12:33.360 in place from the get-go as we're
12:35.600 establishing this EA practice is going
12:38.000 to pay dividends in the long term as
12:40.760 we're executing against projects over
12:42.800 two three four and even five years now
12:46.720 the final two steps steps N9 and 10 for
12:49.480 me they really kind of bring everything
12:51.800 together and it's really about what I
12:54.040 talk about so much on this channel so
12:57.639 step nine is all about measuring and
13:00.760 improving our EA practice as time goes
13:03.880 on so as we think about the ADM life
13:07.040 cycle that I've talked about in the past
13:08.839 that's part of toggaf and where we're
13:10.839 thinking about architecture designs in
13:12.959 general we want to make sure that as we
13:15.199 get to certain stages within an EA
13:17.639 project that we're going back and we're
13:19.880 evaluating both how we delivered against
13:22.760 that project as well as how the
13:24.680 architecture Stacks up to what those
13:26.680 business objectives are that we set
13:28.600 forth now over time we know that
13:31.279 business priorities are going to change
13:33.880 and so our ability to measure and
13:36.000 constantly be improving and what we're
13:37.959 doing within our architectures and
13:40.399 within our EA practice is going to be
13:43.480 crucial and then the last step step 10
13:46.959 is really about going through and
13:49.519 developing a culture of change within
13:52.079 our EA practice within our organizations
13:55.399 both on the engineering and the IT side
13:58.720 so so often we think that just because
14:00.959 we've delivered on this project that now
14:03.600 we're done and it's going to live that
14:05.800 way for a long period of time and it
14:08.199 certainly might but often times we need
14:10.959 to realize that things are going to
14:13.000 change whether it's external factors
14:15.399 like markets changing or an economic
14:17.839 downturn or it's internal factors we had
14:20.639 a change of leadership within our
14:22.800 organizations or we've had a change of
14:24.720 Direction based off of customer feedback
14:27.680 and so we need our EA practice to help
14:30.240 us as CTO and cios as well as the
14:34.240 stakeholders the EA board and the EA
14:36.800 team members to understand that over
14:39.440 time things are going to change and so
14:41.639 as we're constantly evaluating where we
14:44.000 are and going through a ea practice life
14:47.480 cycle we want to make sure that we're
14:49.360 making change incrementally based on the
14:52.040 changing requirements that we're faced
14:54.000 as an organization and as a business and
14:57.040 when we Implement all 10 of these steps
14:59.680 together this is how we are going to be
15:01.959 able to have a successful EA practice
15:05.079 established within our organizations one
15:07.759 that's ultimately going to be able to
15:09.440 help us be able to deliver that improved
15:12.199 decisionmaking one that's going to be
15:13.959 able to help us optimize our it and
15:16.639 Cloud assets because we understand the
15:19.519 complete vision of everything that we're
15:21.600 doing across engineering and it to be
15:24.880 able to deliver for the business to be
15:27.040 able to deliver for our customers and
15:29.040 ultimately be able to drive a profit
15:31.360 that's really what we're all after in
15:33.199 the long run and then finally this EA
15:36.279 practice as we've talked about by using
15:38.360 these 10 steps is going to be able to
15:40.480 help you as a CTO or CIO be able to
15:43.880 realize enhanced business agility within
15:46.560 your teams and organizations and
15:49.440 ultimately that's what this is all about
15:52.360 so often organizations get bogged down
15:55.079 with the minutia of the day-to-day
15:56.959 projects and this EA practice that we
16:00.040 establish within our companies should
16:02.199 allow us and our team members to be able
16:04.839 to take the long Vision out and be able
16:07.279 to see everything that's out on the
16:09.319 horizon for us that we're executing
16:11.199 against to make sure that we're all
16:13.120 working in lock step towards a goal and
16:16.720 ultimately that's what this video is all
16:19.120 about making sure that you can be
16:21.240 successful in your digital
16:22.920 Transformations and that you don't find
16:25.040 yourself victim of one of the many
16:27.360 failures that Gardner is telling us that
16:29.720 organizations are experiencing when they
16:31.800 take on a digital transformation project
16:34.680 one of the massive barriers that we've
16:36.240 talked about before is the inability of
16:38.360 organizations to marry the vision and
16:40.639 the strategy with the actual execution
16:43.319 and that's what establishing an EA
16:45.040 practice is going to help you solve
16:47.000 within your
16:48.360 organizations now if you're enjoying

05.359 so this presentation is developing an effective ea repository with great amounts of data comes great
12.320 responsibility and how to transform your repository into that single source of truth to make informed decisions
20.880 so the agenda on this presentation is um showing you how um how we created a
21.000 No text
26.400 roadmap in the boarding of the ea repository how to build an effective meta model um
31.760 for business application data and technology architectural streams uh what are the
39.520 sources of truth of the data what does the integration process look like
44.879 how to produce the content to provide those beneficial insights and make them engaging and how does that
50.719 take up look like how to mature the ea capability through the use of the repository
55.840 and finally i will take any questions and i hope to answer them
000.960 so a little bit about me um charlie mentioned uh i'm a senior enterprise architect in einstein i've worked with then star
007.439 for nearly two years now um have a background about over four and a half years in enterprise architecture
014.640 but i have an overall uh 20 years experience in iit and consultancy um developing
021.200 systems and products and architecting solutions i worked in many different
028.799 sectors predominantly insurance also finance manufacturing energy motoring retail and
035.360 entertainment just a disclaimer all opinions expressed or implied in this presentation of those
041.520 of myself they don't necessarily reflect the views of enstar or evolution
046.799 and my linkedin address is below so a little bit about nstar so it was
050.000 No text
053.280 founded in 1993 um it has a global footprint
058.640 of over 30 offices headquarters in bermuda but many offices in the u.s eu
02:05.200 and australia it has over a thousand employees and has made a hundred acquisitions since its
02:12.080 formation so endstar is a insurance run-off consolidator
02:17.840 for non-life runoff insurance and this would be employees liability workers comp marine
02:23.840 transport aviation and construction and he became the largest runoff consolidator in 2013
02:30.160 and offers expertise in risk analysis and investment so manages insurance and reinsurance
02:36.879 companies and portfolios um and here's sort of a diagram an
02:42.319 example to show um what that process looks like when we when install makes an acquisition
02:49.760 looks at the sellers who wish to sell their um books of business for for a premium so
02:55.760 it enters an agreement with the seller to cover the future claims for that premium
03:01.360 and that could be through a number of sell options either share purchase portfolio transfer or
03:07.200 reinsurance arrangements so this other benefits from this from the release
03:13.440 of its capital and the administration efforts enstar then
03:19.680 invests in that premium it gains from the sale and then manages and handles those claims
03:26.799 the profit it returns to the shareholders is the return of investment plus any
03:32.239 claim savings nsar also offers opportunities for computation which is offsetting the
03:38.480 credits and debts as we've acquired multiple books of business or portfolios over the years
03:44.720 that that's that's the that means that it's increases or maximizes the profit to the
03:50.319 shareholders so because of the um ever-changing
03:54.000 No text
03:57.519 landscape of n-star with its acquisitions and divestments the landscape does change considerably
04:04.159 and provides those um it provides a challenge for for
04:09.840 for ourselves so across the the world in the eu us and the rest of
04:16.160 the world end star is actually comprised of a number of holding companies
04:21.918 within those holding companies there's a number of limited insurance and reinsurance
04:26.960 companies within those insurance companies there's a number of books of business
04:33.520 that are managed by those limited companies and with this complex
04:40.840 business there's a systems landscape beneath it all that has a number of
04:48.160 systems shared services across claims reinsurance finance systems data warehouses data
04:53.919 marts that provide the data ultimately to the reporting platforms so it always becomes a constant
04:59.440 challenge to try to understand the future with the future acquisitions or future divestments what the system
05:06.240 landscape could look like or should look like
05:11.919 and there's more um common uh challenges that i'm sure many of you will be aware of that
05:19.360 there's a number of repositories for documentation that can exist in ms teams sharepoint document libraries or
05:26.400 existing ea repositories which we which we have or they could just sit on someone's local drive or email or even people's
05:31.840 heads and those and the type of diagrams that are often beneficial for change can be spread in
05:38.880 many of these different areas and they're often of good quality at that point of time but over years
05:45.520 they become locked in people's heads or the the discovery process becomes challenging
05:50.800 so when there are new business opportunities or um or through acquisitions or if there's drivers to
05:56.400 improve the business efficiencies such as finance process improvements or claims handling or there's um there's new
06:04.880 regulations in in certain um jurisdiction um then this offers um a challenge
06:12.800 when it comes to change and the discovery and analysis of this documentation um can take weeks
06:20.240 and this is what we see the the ea repository um to help reduce that time considerably
06:28.000 No text
06:28.880 so what was our journey um how do we board from the initial procurement of
06:35.440 up abacus well once we went through the initial
06:40.639 selection procedure we started to configure and set this up
06:46.080 we had initial training with our core architecture team and some initial kickoff sessions
06:52.479 and through this initial setup we then created a first draft of the meta model and this
06:59.039 was just to understand how to configure it uh set up some basic users and groups
07:04.160 and then ways of working um and we started work on the initial content
07:10.160 and after about eight weeks um we started to create some true content so we had a meta model that was able to to be
07:17.599 utilized for some solution diagrams we were creating for existing projects
07:23.440 uh we had a integration set up with us our configuration management the
07:29.039 database service now and we started to create dashboards showing the technical debt matrix
07:37.599 then we started to publish this information to a wider audience within
07:42.639 the enterprise started to create our capability models
07:47.680 um looking from a level one down to level three and even level four um creating more dashboards ready for
07:54.319 publishing and some high-level enterprise architecture views
08:00.560 then as we started to increase the amount of content over sort of four month period we
08:06.240 started to onboard some of the existing work that we had done prior to adopting
08:12.160 the tool such as the application roadmap three year plan we started creating some traditional
08:17.919 architecture diagrams we increased the meta model and the constraints between them and created
08:23.599 more viewpoints and and now from six months onwards we're we're we're
08:29.440 we're embedding the process into core solution architecture work and we've got dashboards that are used
08:35.519 for a wider consumption and we had the demos to the i.t buildings at large and to other
08:40.640 stakeholders outside in in the business and now we're starting to look at what does the governance and
08:46.959 change process and control look like to content authors and looking to begin this adoption
08:52.640 outside of the architecture community
08:57.000 No text
08:59.040 so the first thing we want to do is to look at the meta model and the approach to that was
09:04.959 to look at a model that would fulfill all potential use cases create a base meta model that couldn't
09:10.880 be expanded as the content evolves but utilize the best of breed of existing languages
09:16.959 we didn't want to reinvent the wheel completely and we wanted to limit the number of allowed connections
09:24.640 uh i believe in when we to create content there's no right answer to create the diagrams but a simplified
09:30.720 model can really help to provide that consistency
09:36.000 so we looked at archimate as the as the boilerplate if you like um for creating the meta model but we
09:42.320 took lots of elements from bizbok um for the business architecture um
09:47.360 viewpoints and we also used some components of the bpmn notation as
09:52.880 well so we could provide better business process to diagrams that are understood by the business
10:02.839 analysts so this then creates our own n-star meta model
10:08.240 that is um you know it's got some specific elements to to n-style but it can be
10:14.160 used i think in across of other other industry areas as well
10:19.000 No text
10:20.000 the metamodel design looks like this we have a quite a rich number of component types
10:25.120 now in our repository we have and they're all
10:30.640 composed into various groups so we have motivational component types people strategy
10:37.360 project business application the data and infrastructure
10:43.200 and these component types are used across a number of viewpoints so we have uh we started creating the
10:49.040 solution architecture viewpoint as our first one and then created a business architecture
10:54.160 one and we created a business with the benefit viewpoint as well which would be of use i think with
101.680 portfolio managers in the future and then we created the bpm diagram and we have a graph
107.440 viewpoint as well which is useful for the enterprise dashboards the ones that we're looking to do in the
113.200 future is a sort of a cloud specific technology viewpoint and one that's specific to um projects
118.880 and programs and looking at showing how change affects the system landscapes
127.000 No text
128.720 so this is our solution architecture viewpoint and you can see here that the
134.000 application component type is sort of central to to to this viewpoint and with in here we
140.160 have the concept of an application that is composed of application modules
145.440 um with other logical components that aren't native to archimate such as the logical with the database and the
150.959 logical the document store we wanted to show how relational databases or document
156.480 repositories look within these kind of views these are then linked to physical
12:03.600 counterparts so we have the physical database or database instance then that relates
12:10.240 to a logical database so we're able to show environments uh specific
12:15.920 uh views as well with this one single viewpoint uh we also have the data objects as well
12:22.399 so we have the concept of a data set which can can correspond to either a database schema
12:29.519 in a relational database or record or a report schema in power bi or cognos or some other bi tool
12:36.959 and then the data objects correspond to uh let's say a data table and then you can then identify
12:43.600 individual data writer elements within here as well
12:49.000 No text
12:50.480 for the business architecture viewpoint um this is um capability organization and value
12:58.000 streams essential to this to this viewpoint uh we wanted to show uh capabilities and how they realize
13:06.079 the value stream and the value stream stages are components within value streams
13:11.839 components within the value streams um and a couple of motivational view
13:17.440 component types as well on how those value streams serve either external or internal stakeholders
13:23.040 the organizations are composed of business units that realize business functions of which
13:29.040 the business processes then serve those business functions and they also relate to the value streams
13:35.440 we have um some specific component types here we've got portfolio and class of business where we wanted to
13:41.920 show which organizations own which portfolios and which portfolios then manages or has
13:48.720 specific classes of business and though they're then also linked to applications
13:54.480 and then applications which applications support which classes of business
14:03.440 and then the technology viewpoints at the moment we we we've got one that's um utilizing graph
14:09.680 dots which is a great visualization in of abacus um where we can see from a particular
14:17.120 starting node such as a server what relationships um are associated to those
14:22.639 um to that starting node so a server might be hosted on a particular
14:28.240 location um hosted in within the data center or in the cloud
14:33.920 um we'll have number of infrastructure services those application modules then will be linked to an application
14:41.519 those applications can be allocated up to an each ecosystem uh one thing i forgot to mention in the
14:46.880 other slide is that we use the ecosystem as a term to um group up
14:52.160 a more granular level of applications so that it's easier to communicate and convey
14:58.160 certain decisions when these high-level groupings are used
15:06.000 No text
15:07.839 we have a benefit realization viewpoint where um where in order to justify
15:15.760 the project or to initiate a project we we have these mandates or charters and there's
15:21.199 always a benefits case to determine um is it worth doing is it worth doing
15:26.399 this project um and one of the i think the flexible things of
15:31.440 abacus is to be able to create viewpoints like this where we can actually quantify what the benefits are and to
15:37.199 show that in a diagram so that's key to decision stakeholders can actually use this
15:42.240 and they can see and measure um what those 2b capability models should would look
15:49.040 like with the solution changes and how the projects and the deliverables on those projects
15:54.160 then realize those changes in the capabilities and then we can show how these then are
15:59.519 aligned to any strategic objectives
16:04.800 and then link to the ultimate mission and vision of which drives those objectives
16:15.000 No text
16:16.560 our bp men viewpoints the goal here was to use the existing component types in the
16:22.560 meta model as much as we could so that's when we talk about a business process either in an archimate focus
16:28.240 diagram or a bpm diagram here they are the same thing
16:33.839 and that was easy to do what we're able to um show here is that the activities
16:41.040 that you see here are actually just business processes and the events the triggers are business
16:48.880 events and we used um super types and and then derived
16:54.399 types to show which are message events for example or start and end events
17:01.519 and those then can be linked to the value streams here so that's whether you're we've created a
17:07.919 process flow diagram at this level where it's you can see the the swim lanes associated with either business units or
17:16.839 roles those saying this same um contenting it can be used in
17:22.079 a argument style diagram could look different but mean exactly the same thing um we also wanted to extend this
17:27.760 particular view to show value stream as well because that means that we can show where the relationship between
17:33.120 processes business processes to value streams to capabilities and that triangle then helps helps drive
17:40.320 these conversations that we need that these are useful for
17:46.000 No text
17:47.440 so how do we um what is our integration strategy look like into the a repository so as we
17:54.400 were growing the contents um in the a repository we have a num we had a number of
18:00.000 existing sources so one of the goals was to um adopt uh
18:05.919 abacus was to try to consolidate this try to create these single views so that um i t multiple
18:13.520 it teams or other business teams didn't have their own source of data
18:18.880 they could they could use a trusted source of data but there's challenges to that as you
18:24.960 can see here there's uh in abacus like you see in the center
18:30.640 there are a number of existing um data sources and repositories um that have its own source of data and
18:38.320 some of these are um good and accurate and can be used um and some of them would probably
18:45.919 would benefit from being synchronized from another data source so we have existing for example we have
18:51.840 existing like spreadsheets vendor spreadsheets but it was very
18:56.880 manually maintained um not shown on here but we we are adopting a um
19:03.200 a management software event event i'm sorry a vendor related vendor management software package that
19:09.520 we're just introducing now so that will help um you know consolidate and make
19:15.360 um make that more of a trusted source but with all these data sources we have
19:21.280 trying to describe here in this diagram is the notion of a source of record and ultimate source
19:26.320 of record what is a trusted source what's a copy of the data that's local and useful for that particular function
19:32.960 that that software is used for and this was a very useful diagram um when conveying this to various i.t
19:40.160 stakeholders and trying to describe the nature of the problem and how do we consolidate and improve the quality of
19:47.200 the data across these different systems as we
19:52.240 are now um adopting a cloud platform for all of our services uh and applications
19:59.520 it now becomes a source of record for um database database instances servers
20:06.720 applications to some extent and that and that information then needs to be re-synchronized
20:12.000 to abacus we've determined the best way to do that in order to keep any cloud hosted
20:19.520 systems and non-cloud asset systems is to centralize that in our existing cmdb
20:25.360 server so this is where we will synchronize this via this service map
20:30.720 uh component that you might just be able to see on the cloud platform area and then we would synchronize that
20:36.960 information into abacus so it becomes a trusted source but other
20:42.559 items that are very useful for us such as the tco of applications that won't be source and
20:48.480 servicenow we have to get that by some other means and this is where um we're looking to
20:53.840 um connect to the uh cloud platforms api to pull that billing information in
20:59.280 there so we can get good financial data that can be used at the server level and aggregated up to k applications and then
206.080 to capabilities and in all of these um component types
211.280 to sort of raise the discussion about how do we improve and change this with we've used the
217.440 color coding uh attributes to show what's the data accuracy look like now what does it should it be
223.840 and the data completeness and this has been good to communicate
228.960 to say this is where we want to get to in order to make people come to
235.120 abacus as a good trusted source
241.000 No text
241.280 the cmdp process we adopted initially was to look at how the date the applications
246.640 was mastered in in one repository because they've been created separately
253.280 from how we would documents and
258.559 applications because its primary purpose is to be used for support and to create and
22:04.400 raise i.t service tickets they aren't the applications need to be
22:09.760 mapped slightly differently into um into what we would call applications and
22:16.480 i think this is a i think this is a reasonable thing to do there's maybe always an element of
22:21.600 transformation um based on the use cases or the purpose of that source system
22:27.280 so we created a script that looked at a particular attribute here we've got application import mapping type and decided is this
22:35.840 should this be a application component that sits in a parent application um should it be ignored completely
22:42.240 because it's just a business service um and one or two other attributes and
22:47.520 that way we have a good clean hazard architecture that can still be traced back to its source
22:53.280 information and then understood what mode of synchronization
22:59.760 happens between it and using the cmdb identifier which is a guide to uniquely
23:06.799 identify that component should we ever want to look back to that sort of system also in identifying where there are
23:12.880 discrepancies where we should think they should be changed at source this is a group this was a great opportunity to be able to do
23:18.240 that because we then had a list of applications and modules and to go and then go back
23:23.600 to the cdb owner to then challenge or to change what that all that data should look like
23:34.000 No text
23:34.840 so how did we look or approach the uh repository maturity there's a
23:41.919 number of use cases that we identified in the initial selection criteria and i think there's it was certainly a
23:48.640 journey we were definitely still all very much on that journey to look at maturing
23:53.679 the the the areas and the use cases of uh because where it could be used in
23:58.960 within end star to start with um the architecture team
24:05.760 um has a number of consumers that we work on projects solution architectures uh tuition architects work on with the
24:12.240 projects and there's it exec and there's other business execs and we want to create
24:18.000 solution architecture we do platform reviews um we were able to share technical debt
24:23.440 able to help in strategic decisions and help acquisitions and the benefits
24:29.919 here wanted to to show and to quantify what the benefits are in order to bring
24:36.000 that data together i think there's with all of these as a journey from simple awareness to
24:42.080 to show to uh for example exact same business exec so this is all very nice to actually adopt
24:47.919 in it and for them to want to come to us to actually get this to get this information and i think this all comes
24:53.520 back to the quality trying to get the quality of the data in there to show that they can trust the the the architecture
25:00.880 team and up and up abacus is a trusted source um so then that maturity then gets
25:08.400 raised so because wrong may be adopted to an embedded process
25:15.600 and for business analysts we are doing that right now so we're now extending the use of abacus outside of
25:22.480 core architecture team and business analysts are now starting to to utilize it for um
25:28.240 as is analysis or on project analysis to look at the 2b
25:33.520 and the benefits of this is is sort of described it can now dovetail exactly to our
25:39.679 capability maps to understand what that scope what what does that project scope look like
25:46.720 and it ultimately will reduce analysis time in future projects
25:53.679 the finance management this is what we are starting to really want to
26:00.080 go beyond from awareness to adoption now is is to take that information take the financial information from our
26:07.120 cloud provider and then we're able to um map those tcos from the servers to the capabilities and
26:13.679 business units and this is and then an opportunity um for finance management to then look at and identify
26:19.520 uh future cost savings i'll be from a purely environment server level
26:26.240 uh looking at efficiencies across there or in terms of run costs or licensing costs or looking at all
26:33.600 whole capabilities how to optimize the costs across a capability
26:39.760 and for the data governance this is something that we are um on track now we've we have an
26:46.960 existing um the data data lineage and data glossary application and we have
26:54.960 data stewards who now own own the data within nstar
27:00.240 and and this is now a great tool to take that information from that existing
27:06.080 tool and to start to embed that within the ea repository to become a single source of truth
27:14.159 and that then bridges the the gaps between it supported or the the data between it supported system
27:20.799 and data that sits outside of those supported systems in excel or some other um or
27:28.640 access databases or other files that's that that are out there in the wild so it's a good way to bring
27:34.159 the two together so we can then have proper informed decisions about um
27:39.360 target states um and driving future projects
27:45.760 one area we've not really looked at yet is the risk of compliance is um but i think it could be of benefit
27:52.320 is to um start to document um cyber or disaster recovery risks and
27:58.559 how those could be measured against technical debt and other components in in the repository
28:04.480 and then maybe to look at whole different controls that can be used and recorded and measured against those it services
28:13.000 No text
28:13.840 so the approach to building out the content um it's like where where's where to start is always always the biggest one of the biggest
28:19.679 questions i think it's to this diagram here just to sort of
28:24.720 illustrate a way to look at it um is to start thinking about in order
28:29.840 to answer some questions um how many component types do you need in order to answer that question
28:36.799 um here it's described as the breadth the depth here is how much coverage do
28:42.240 you need per component type how many how accurate and complete does the data need to be before it becomes useful and
28:48.960 trusted and obviously the the wider it is and
28:54.159 the deeper it is the longer it it takes to create that content
28:59.919 so when starting out and i'll just i've got a number of examples here
29:05.360 it's it's easy and it's one of one things that we did is to look at a conceptual target state architecture
29:11.600 you don't need many existing components to describe what that can look like and again this this is also this is already a useful
29:18.880 um diagram and tool uh to convey um and then we can start looking at um
29:26.480 as is models in a given domain we use this for the financial transformation program
29:34.320 and capabilities and value stream mappings um that requires just a couple of component
29:40.559 types but when you start to bring in the data from another data source that has a rich
29:47.120 complete set of data such as cmgb to provide information such as technical debt then the depth of that coverage
29:53.440 increases and then you're able to do more things such as the the data lineage between um supported
29:59.440 systems and non-supported systems and ultimately things like capability and mapping that
30:04.559 to the applications and mapping that to to the servers
30:14.880 so these are things i've sort of listed to sort of watch out for it's it's it's i think as any um
30:22.240 repository starts to mature and there's more content being produced
30:27.360 there's also a lot more gotchas to make sure that it doesn't become another graveyard of information so
30:34.640 when content is not validated or it can't be trusted is is one concern it might just be
30:40.080 created for a point of interest for one particular discussion point but then it might become out of date
30:46.000 very quickly or there's there's no ownership of that content after it's been created so people lose sight of what that purpose
30:52.480 of the diagram was can can we use it at all for anything else um there could be multiple copies of
30:59.120 similar diagrams within the same architecture
304.559 or worse still when emails when there's been copies of of the diagram that's
311.120 been downloaded and emailed to senior stakeholders and their and their information their
316.240 basis of information is on that particular version which might not be the final version of the version that is is sourced and
321.840 mastered in in in in the repository it could be multiple sub architectures
328.320 so people creating 2b architectures or or their own workspaces that aren't
334.559 synchronized up and become out of date and there could be and when there are
339.919 content authors outside of the core architecture team which is something i think any maturity
345.279 curve should should do is how to manage and curate that contents that's been driven do they
350.559 have different ideas of what what what the data types should be within well what the content should be
356.000 within a particular component type so it's understanding what things could be done to to
32:01.360 to harmonize the data the crowds the crowdsourcing approach of the data coming from multiple different sources
32:10.960 so one of the things we've done and i think it is early stages for us is to is to look at ways to improve that
32:16.799 so we we put in a very light search control framework within uh within our ear repository
32:23.039 where we have a number of high level categories that have um associated diagrams and
32:29.440 dashboards and to subjectively um identify what their accuracy and completeness is
32:35.519 when it was last checked so the idea of this is to is to provide a data source owner
32:43.440 um to make sure that they are responsible for these areas we have regular sessions we have a
32:49.440 bi-weekly purely just housekeeping to go through um the repository to identify um
32:56.240 which of these areas is out of date or which of these areas needs to be checked um and to
33:03.679 and to refresh those where there might be multiple sub architectures are redundant and can be
33:10.240 deleted uh or copies of diagrams that within the same architecture that could be
33:15.279 removed as well so we're trying to clean up as we go along so far that's been pretty good i think
33:22.799 we we can do more around the the the meta models the controls in the order control process
33:29.440 so we can go further where we maybe timestamp the individual diagrams and have them listed in another catalog
33:35.519 like this and to really identify where we think diagrams are not used or out of date
33:48.640 so things that we have done we can currently answer and show within um within the tool
33:56.559 so we we can do the itt run so we can we we have taken we haven't got real time synchronization but we
34:03.279 um but from manual imports we are able to look at the it run cost and aggregate that across servers and
34:10.079 applications capability and we have some very good high level and detailed level
34:16.879 solution diagrams and process flow diagrams in our finance systems and some detailed process flow diagrams
34:24.719 in our seeded reinsurance systems we're able to share the application roadmap in terms of invest tolerated
34:31.679 migrate we've used it to do a very thorough and detailed major business transition
34:36.800 um showing detailed business architecture steps and what that transition looks like
34:43.359 we can show the technical debt so we can show which operating the operating systems are running on which servers and then can identify
34:50.719 which applications those are related to to help provide it forecast and budget for future years
34:57.280 we have a very good detailed uh n-style capability model now and we also have a detailed organization
35:03.520 to portfolio diagram model
35:09.119 so the following slides is just looking at a few specific use cases that we've used
35:10.000 No text
35:15.680 abacus for so initiative we said earlier this year to identify
35:20.720 where we could implement solutions at low cost where there could be significant savings
35:26.640 in an otherwise manually intensive process typically we were looking at
35:32.160 projects that would only take two to four weeks so current debt management capability
35:38.320 within the seated ri space is is is a problem that we that was identified
35:44.560 particularly around query analysis and that's what the process we have with reinsurance with money
35:49.839 zones or disputes and we used abacus to measure what that capability performance looked like
35:58.560 and then using the tool able to then create a target state architecture in this case
36:04.640 it was using powerapps and power bi to look at automation of this and then we were able to
36:10.240 implement a solution in the racial space of time and then immediately show
36:15.839 where those systems improvements were through that automation process so they were very this was a very good
36:22.960 and effective way to um annotate the capabilities with effectiveness ratings
36:29.200 so that we can look at short-term wins where we know there are deficiencies
36:35.839 in some of the capabilities within n-star
36:41.000 No text
36:42.000 another use case is cost analysis as we described we have here from left to right the
36:48.000 total server costs across a number of applications and immediately there you can drill down
36:54.480 into what those costs are especially sort of in the top five and to see you know is it environment
37:01.359 specific is it licenses um is it other factors that contribute
37:07.200 to a high cost that we might want to
37:12.240 reduce so we're able to do that very well within the tool just with our integration into into cmdb um
37:20.800 we wanted to take this further where we could look at bau support costs and then measure um put tcos against
37:28.640 head count across it support and business support as well so that would help in future cases where
37:35.440 we're looking at key strategic decisions in terms of the organization drivers
37:40.880 where they want to go next with with certain parts of the business
37:46.000 No text
37:46.800 and another good use case is that the data lineage and business glossary piece so uh as i mentioned earlier we
37:54.400 have a power we have a report we have power bi that's produced
37:59.760 that produces um glossary and lineage information and that information is currently
38:06.400 separate from applicants we want to now integrate that so we can have that combined view
38:13.839 and do it but we don't need to change the reports those can still be used
38:20.800 across other key users who find our particular view useful so through
38:26.400 the abacus api we're still able to produce these types of reports where we can
38:33.040 still show business glossary information and the data lineage information we can
38:38.640 show here the for instance we have a decomposition tree where we've got the lineage from the
38:44.079 ultimate source to the ultimate or the ultimate child to the ultimate parents in terms of what what does the
38:49.760 data flow look like between all of the different steps and by using using the api
38:57.280 through the data source query and we were able to do that
39:04.000 No text
39:05.359 in the case of the major transformation program that sub best part a few years
39:12.960 is there were lots of projects that were happening concurrently around different instances of
39:18.160 some key systems that we were implementing across the eu in the us there was no one single
39:26.320 they all had different stakeholders so it's very confusing to understand to um business ex exactly what does that
39:33.520 solution landscape look like and what does the impact look like across all of the different regions we were
39:40.320 also we decided to annotate the application component type to show
39:45.520 where is the new development or where there was production changes it was in production but it was undergoing changes or it was live but
39:52.240 there was no changes at all this this key insight was very useful
39:57.680 to show um to all um project teams and and finance and cfos
40:04.880 to show what those interdependencies look like for those applications and how they
40:11.359 and how they were developed within the projects
40:17.000 No text
40:17.440 another use case was looking at the organizational mapping this helped um companies acquisitions
40:26.000 accompany divestment plans where we wanted to show how the applications
40:31.359 are serving which capabilities and which organizations which you see on the x-axis here um
40:38.640 are owned by own which applications so we can see this complex matrix this
40:43.839 actually helps provide that key information when there are company divestments or acquisitions
40:49.839 and what does that system landscape change look like
40:57.000 No text
40:57.040 so the application roadmap for us um so we've done quite a lot already in in
402.400 the uh i think it's one year now since since we since we purchased the tool and we have
407.920 um more things planned um in 2021 and beyond um so for business
414.480 architecture we're looking at the um we want to do more performance metrics we wanted
419.599 to do more subjective analysis on um the capability maps and business unit
426.640 to application mapping and drill down to level twos and level three capabilities
431.680 um for solution architecture that has now become an embedded process
436.880 but we want to onboard a lot of the existing work that we've done such as the existing enterprise assessment
443.280 diagrams and matrices that we've done manually in powerpoint for example um to continue the bpm
449.440 process diagrams to get more of the ba community using this so it becomes an embedded
454.880 process as well on the data architecture stream um we have uh our master
42:02.800 reference data models in in in the system we're able to show what that source of target looked
42:08.079 like across all the different um applications and now we're looking and planning to
42:13.599 introduce and implement the data glossary and the data lineage information in there as well
42:19.680 for integration automation um so as i mentioned we want to integrate our cloud service information get the
42:27.280 service map and cost monitoring information into there as well and to provide any um outputs into into bi into power bi as
42:35.200 we use reporting tools um so they could be shown in multiple ways to
42:42.000 different audiences and for metrics say we wanted to bring
42:48.400 in more vendor information more real-time information from the new vendor management system
42:53.599 and this is with a view that we could potentially ultimately replace our current bi finance bi solution against saving money
43:00.640 and reducing complexity of these services and for the adoption we say we're using
43:07.119 it um extensively in project architecture um we're starting to use it in um in
43:14.319 discussions around business architecture and transition models we want to do more with acquisitions um
43:21.040 to provide more useful information for target state scenarios and to use it embed the process in 90
43:27.200 financial planning and key it strategic planning and ultimately business plan
